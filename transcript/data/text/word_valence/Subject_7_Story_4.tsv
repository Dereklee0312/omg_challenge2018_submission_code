a	0.5

there	0.5
was	0.5
a	0.5
huge	0.5
checkin	0.5
queue	0.5
and	0.5
S	0.5
Just	0.5
at	0.5
the	0.5
airport	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
waiting	0.5
to	0.5
many	0.5

Um	0.5
this	0.5
flight	0.5
was	0.5
reaching	0.5
two	0.5
hours	0.5
early	0.5
I	0.5
could	0.5
barely	0.5
manage	0.5
to	0.5
get	0.5
to	0.5
the	0.5
boarding	0.5
S	0.5
Because	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
checkin	0.5
the	0.5
security	0.5
its	0.5
just	0.5
S	0.5
Too	0.5
many	0.5
people	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
there	0.5
were	0.5
no	0.5

do	0.5
handle	0.5
this	0.5
many	0.5
people	0.5
L	0.5
Uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
I	0.5
reached	0.5
at	0.5
the	0.5
gate	0.5
at	0.5
like	0.5
S	0.5
Two	0.5
minutes	0.5

five	0.5
minutes	0.5
before	0.5
the	0.5
boarding	0.5
closes	0.5
S	0.5
They	0.5
allowed	0.5
me	0.5
in	0.5
but	0.5
they	0.5
were	0.5
not	0.5
very	0.5
happy	0.5
with	0.5
that	0.5
S	0.5
breath	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5

somehow	0.5
these	0.5
flights	0.5
dont	0.5
have	0.5
these	0.5
bridges	0.5
to	0.5
the	0.5
plane	0.5
then	0.5
you	0.5
have	0.5
to	0.5
go	0.5
down	0.5
and	0.5
take	0.5
the	0.5
bus	0.5
L	0.5
Yes	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
and	0.5
you	0.5
know	0.5

somehow	0.5
these	0.5
flights	0.5
dont	0.5
have	0.5
these	0.5

you	0.5
have	0.5
to	0.5
go	0.5
down	0.5

take	0.5
the	0.5
bus	0.5
L	0.5
Yes	0.5
S	0.5
I	0.5
hate	0.5
that	0.5
S	0.5
I	0.5
hate	0.5
taking	0.5
buses	0.5
to	0.5
the	0.5
plane	0.5
Um	0.5
S	0.5
Its	0.5
just	0.5
cramp	0.5
there	0.5
its	0.5
like	0.5
hurts	0.5
getting	0.5
into	0.5
a	0.5
S	0.5
A	0.5
vessel	0.5
and	0.5
then	0.5
transporting	0.5
to	0.5
somewhere	0.5
else	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
its	0.5
weird	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
we	0.5
took	0.5
the	0.5
bus	0.5
Uh	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
went	0.5
around	0.5
the	0.5
airport	0.5
eventually	0.5
reached	0.5
our	0.5
plane	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
we	0.5
took	0.5
the	0.5
bus	0.5
Uh	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
went	0.5
around	0.5
the	0.5
airport	0.5
eventually	0.5
reached	0.5
our	0.5
plane	0.5

then	0.5
I	0.5
realized	0.5
that	0.5
is	0.5
not	0.5
a	0.5
regular	0.5
plane	0.5
was	0.5
that	0.5
a	0.5
smaller	0.5

these	0.5
really	0.5
small	0.5

something	0.5

not	0.5
very	0.5
pleasant	0.5
to	0.5
inaudible	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
we	0.5
were	0.5
in	0.5
ours	0.5
seats	0.5
we	0.5
were	0.5
ready	0.5
to	0.5
fly	0.5
and	0.5
then	0.5
this	0.5
announcement	0.5
that	0.5
says	0.5
Hey	0.5
we	0.5
can	0.5
not	0.5
fly	0.5
right	0.5
now	0.5
because	0.5
well	0.5
the	0.5
flight	0.5
control	0.5
says	0.5
S	0.5
The	0.5
weather	0.5
is	0.5
bad	0.5
for	0.5
takeoff	0.5
or	0.5
something	0.5
and	0.5
then	0.5
we	0.5
are	0.5
grounded	0.5
for	0.5
now	0.5
L	0.5
Uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
we	0.5
dont	0.5
know	0.5
how	0.5
long	0.5
it	0.5
will	0.5
take	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
at	0.5
part	0.5
of	0.5
time	0.5
I	0.5
thought	0.5
what	0.5
the	0.5
heck	0.5
why	0.5
they	0.5
hiding	0.5
it	0.5
from	0.5
us	0.5
in	0.5
that	0.5
point	0.5
of	0.5
time	0.5
then	0.5
S	0.5
You	0.5
must	0.5
know	0.5
this	0.5
for	0.5
some	0.5
time	0.5
given	0.5
the	0.5
other	0.5
flights	0.5
that	0.5
inaudible	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
S	0.5
inaudible	0.5
We	0.5
were	0.5
the	0.5
tarmac	0.5
waiting	0.5
to	0.5
takeoff	0.5
for	0.5
one	0.5
hour	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
this	0.5
they	0.5
dont	0.5
even	0.5
switch	0.5
on	0.5
the	0.5
air	0.5
conditioning	0.5
or	0.5
something	0.5
in	0.5
this	0.5
plane	0.5
so	0.5
we	0.5
were	0.5
just	0.5
sitting	0.5
there	0.5
almost	0.5
no	0.5
oxygen	0.5
then	0.5
S	0.5
Just	0.5
crowded	0.5
up	0.5
in	0.5
this	0.5
really	0.5
small	0.5
place	0.5
S	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
just	0.5
Uh	0.5
breath	0.5
just	0.5
too	0.5
frustrating	0.5
experience	0.5
just	0.5
S	0.5
Even	0.5
before	0.5
the	0.5
flight	0.5
tookoff	0.5
S	0.5
i	0.5
admit	0.5
it	0.5
did	0.5
takeoff	0.5
we	0.5
have	0.5
a	0.5
we	0.5
we	0.5
went	0.5
to	0.5
the	0.5
runway	0.5
and	0.5
tookoff	0.5
the	0.5
tookoff	0.5
was	0.5
a	0.5
bit	0.5
shaky	0.5
wasnt	0.5
the	0.5
most	0.5
ideal	0.5
one	0.5
S	0.5
Probably	0.5
was	0.5
too	0.5
windy	0.5
for	0.5
then	0.5
to	0.5
handle	0.5
such	0.5
a	0.5
light	0.5
plane	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
we	0.5
climb	0.5
up	0.5
to	0.5
this	0.5
Uh	0.5
cruising	0.5
altitude	0.5
and	0.5
S	0.5
Like	0.5
all	0.5
what	0.5
we	0.5
do	0.5
is	0.5
lose	0.5
a	0.5
belt	0.5
inaudible	0.5
people	0.5
want	0.5
to	0.5
use	0.5
the	0.5
lavatories	0.5
S	0.5
Apparently	0.5
they	0.5
told	0.5
us	0.5
not	0.5
we	0.5
could	0.5
do	0.5
that	0.5
S	0.5
We	0.5
can	0.5
take	0.5
off	0.5
ours	0.5
sit	0.5
belts	0.5
because	0.5
was	0.5
turbulence	0.5
all	0.5
the	0.5
time	0.5
S	0.5
The	0.5
plane	0.5
started	0.5
moving	0.5
from	0.5
left	0.5
to	0.5
right	0.5
because	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
to	0.5
shaky	0.5
S	0.5
They	0.5
stopped	0.5
the	0.5
use	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
lavatories	0.5
inaudible	0.5
after	0.5
some	0.5
time	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
as	0.5
we	0.5
were	0.5
stuck	0.5
in	0.5
our	0.5
sit	0.5
the	0.5
plane	0.5
just	0.5
shaking	0.5
and	0.5
Um	0.5
S	0.5
In	0.5
my	0.5
head	0.5
Im	0.5

what	0.5
in	0.5
the	0.5

do	0.5
I	0.5
take	0.5
this	0.5

it	0.5
gets	0.5
worst	0.5
S	0.5
The	0.5
lights	0.5
go	0.5
off	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
plane	0.5
S	0.5
Apparently	0.5
there	0.5
was	0.5
too	0.5
much	0.5
turbulence	0.5
and	0.5
then	0.5
some	0.5
systems	0.5
just	0.5
got	0.5

something	0.5
the	0.5

go	0.5
off	0.5

And	0.5
its	0.5
lighting	0.5

we	0.5
had	0.5
these	0.5
flashes	0.5
of	0.5
light	0.5
coming	0.5
in	0.5
for	0.5
us	0.5
seeming	0.5
like	0.5
a	0.5
horror	0.5
movie	0.5

S	0.5
We	0.5
were	0.5
in	0.5
a	0.5

thousands	0.5

feet	0.5
in	0.5
the	0.5

suddenly	0.5
there	0.5
is	0.5

We	0.5
started	0.5
felling	0.5

the	0.5
you	0.5
know	0.5
when	0.5
the	0.5
turbulence	0.5
goes	0.5
up	0.5
the	0.5

inaudible	0.5

At	0.5
the	0.5
end	0.5
of	0.5
this	0.5
free	0.5
falling	0.5
speed	0.5
I	0.5
feel	0.5
like	0.5
that	0.5
S	0.5
Not	0.5
just	0.5
for	0.5
momentary	0.5
but	0.5
for	0.5
like	0.5
Twenty	0.5
seconds	0.5
S	0.5
Its	0.5
like	0.5
it	0.5
felt	0.5
three	0.5
hundred	0.5

hundred	0.5
feet	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
I	0.5
have	0.5

had	0.5
big	0.5

with	0.5
this	0.5
claustrophobia	0.5

crowded	0.5
up	0.5

well	0.5
anyway	0.5

now	0.5
this	0.5
happens	0.5

And	0.5
it	0.5
doesnt	0.5
stop	0.5
it	0.5
just	0.5
keep	0.5
going	0.5
up	0.5
and	0.5
then	0.5
falling	0.5
really	0.5
fast	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
going	0.5
up	0.5
and	0.5
falling	0.5
really	0.5
fast	0.5
and	0.5
in	0.5
one	0.5

dropped	0.5

At	0.5
that	0.5

gonna	0.5
die	0.5
its	0.5
my	0.5
last	0.5

its	0.5

I	0.5
dont	0.5

use	0.5
these	0.5

We	0.5
never	0.5
had	0.5
this	0.5

so	0.5
the	0.5
guys	0.5
next	0.5
to	0.5
me	0.5
kinda	0.5
help	0.5
me	0.5
to	0.5
put	0.5
this	0.5
on	0.5

inaudible	0.5

then	0.5
for	0.5
the	0.5
next	0.5
fifteen	0.5
twenty	0.5
minutes	0.5
we	0.5
were	0.5
just	0.5
doing	0.5
this	0.5
S	0.5
They	0.5
will	0.5
try	0.5
to	0.5
climb	0.5
up	0.5
the	0.5
altitude	0.5
and	0.5
then	0.5
fall	0.5
again	0.5
and	0.5
do	0.5
this	0.5
again	0.5
S	0.5
Terrible	0.5
terrible	0.5
having	0.5
a	0.5
experience	0.5
like	0.5
we	0.5
had	0.5
shaky	0.5
plane	0.5
Uh	0.5
If	0.5
I	0.5
only	0.5
think	0.5
about	0.5
that	0.5
night	0.5
just	0.5
so	0.5
scared	0.5
about	0.5
it	0.5
S	0.5
After	0.5
go	0.5
fifteen	0.5
twenty	0.5
minutes	0.5
it	0.5
kinda	0.5
stabilized	0.5
Uh	0.5
Probably	0.5
we	0.5
were	0.5
reaching	0.5
our	0.5
destination	0.5
so	0.5
they	0.5
started	0.5
to	0.5
S	0.5
The	0.5
lights	0.5
came	0.5
on	0.5
again	0.5
We	0.5
took	0.5
off	0.5
our	0.5
masks	0.5
and	0.5
started	0.5
the	0.5
descent	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
S	0.5
Even	0.5
the	0.5
landing	0.5
was	0.5
bumping	0.5
inaudible	0.5
twice	0.5
before	0.5
it	0.5
landed	0.5
S	0.5
At	0.5
that	0.5
part	0.5
I	0.5
decided	0.5
to	0.5
myself	0.5
I	0.5
will	0.5
never	0.5
gonna	0.5
fly	0.5
again	0.5
S	0.5
At	0.5
least	0.5
not	0.5
in	0.5
inaudible	0.5
Im	0.5
gonna	0.5
make	0.5
sure	0.5
its	0.5
not	0.5
a	0.5
small	0.5
plane	0.5
not	0.5
a	0.5
propeller	0.5
one	0.5
for	0.5
sure	0.5
no	0.5
way	0.5
Im	0.5
doing	0.5
that	0.5
S	0.5
I	0.5
canceled	0.5
my	0.5
flight	0.5
back	0.5
because	0.5
it	0.5
probably	0.5
would	0.5
be	0.5
the	0.5
same	0.5
plane	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
I	0.5
took	0.5
the	0.5
train	0.5
took	0.5
me	0.5
twice	0.5
the	0.5
time	0.5
or	0.5
three	0.5
times	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
time	0.5
but	0.5
at	0.5
least	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
safer	0.5
S	0.5
Even	0.5
now	0.5
I	0.5
think	0.5
I	0.5
would	0.5
never	0.5
Uh	0.5
take	0.5
night	0.5
flight	0.5
out	0.5
of	0.5
this	0.5
place	0.5

S	0.5
Especially	0.5
if	0.5
its	0.5
a	0.5
propeller	0.5
plane	0.5
S	0.5
The	0.5
first	0.5
think	0.5
I	0.5
will	0.5
know	0.5
before	0.5
to	0.5
book	0.5
any	0.5
flight	0.5
its	0.5
what	0.5

it	0.5

what	0.5
time	0.5
its	0.5
flying	0.5

Before	0.5
I	0.5
can	0.5
even	0.5
think	0.5
what	0.5
is	0.5
the	0.5
price	0.5
Ive	0.5
to	0.5
pay	0.5
for	0.5
it	0.5

was	0.5

a	0.5
annoying	0.5
annoying	0.5

a	0.5
scary	0.5
one	0.5
