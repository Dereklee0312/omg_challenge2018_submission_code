myself	0.5
every	0.5
night	0.5
to	0.5
study	0.5
the	0.5
course	0.5
um	0.5
the	0.5
night	0.5
before	0.5
the	0.5
final	0.5
exam	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
had	0.5
to	0.5
pass	0.5
this	0.5
final	0.5
exam	0.5
otherwise	0.5
I	0.5
fail	0.5
the	0.5
course	0.5
right	0.5
S	0.5
the	0.5
night	0.5
before	0.5
the	0.5
final	0.5
exam	0.5
I	0.5
completely	0.5
panicked	0.5
I	0.5
completely	0.5
completely	0.5
panicked	0.5
so	0.5
what	0.5
I	0.5
did	0.5
I	0.5
took	0.5
some	0.5
stripes	0.5
of	0.5
paper	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
make	0.5
some	0.5
notes	0.5
on	0.5
it	0.5
S	0.5
and	0.5
then	0.5
my	0.5
plan	0.5
was	0.5
to	0.5
bring	0.5
this	0.5
during	0.5
the	0.5
exam	0.5
into	0.5
my	0.5
sleeve	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
could	0.5
take	0.5
it	0.5
out	0.5
during	0.5
the	0.5
exam	0.5
and	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
cheat	0.5
the	0.5
exam	0.5
S	0.5
but	0.5
the	0.5
yeah	0.5
and	0.5
then	0.5
came	0.5
the	0.5
day	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
exam	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
did	0.5
it	0.5
S	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
really	0.5
took	0.5
it	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
dont	0.5
know	0.5
if	0.5
he	0.5
saw	0.5
it	0.5
he	0.5
didnt	0.5
tell	0.5
anything	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
made	0.5
the	0.5
exam	0.5
S	0.5
by	0.5
the	0.5
end	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
exam	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
feeling	0.5
so	0.5
bad	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
feeling	0.5
so	0.5
so	0.5
guilty	0.5
so	0.5
heavily	0.5
S	0.5
these	0.5
heavy	0.5
shoulders	0.5
you	0.5
know	0.5
really	0.5
like	0.5
wow	0.5
how	0.5
can	0.5
I	0.5
do	0.5
that	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
really	0.5
ridiculous	0.5
in	0.5
the	0.5
end	0.5
I	0.5
passed	0.5
the	0.5
exam	0.5
S	0.5
but	0.5
the	0.5
day	0.5
after	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
like	0.5
wow	0.5
that	0.5
was	0.5
not	0.5
right	0.5
that	0.5
was	0.5
really	0.5
like	0.5
wow	0.5
really	0.5
really	0.5
down	0.5
really	0.5
dense	0.5
S	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
carried	0.5
this	0.5
with	0.5
me	0.5
over	0.5
over	0.5
and	0.5
over	0.5
I	0.5
mean	0.5
I	0.5
never	0.5
did	0.5
this	0.5
anymore	0.5
I	0.5
think	0.5
maybe	0.5
because	0.5
of	0.5
that	0.5
maybe	0.5
because	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
feeling	0.5
of	0.5
guilt	0.5
of	0.5
um	0.5
S	0.5
failing	0.5
from	0.5
with	0.5
myself	0.5
so	0.5
so	0.5
strong	0.5
like	0.5
it	0.5
is	0.5
a	0.5
lesson	0.5
that	0.5
I	0.5
learned	0.5
was	0.5
really	0.5
strong	0.5
in	0.5
my	0.5
teenage	0.5
times	0.5
