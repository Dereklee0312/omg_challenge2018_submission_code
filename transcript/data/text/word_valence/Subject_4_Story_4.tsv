um	0.5
S	0.5
Then	0.5
after	0.5
an	0.5
hour	0.5

something	0.5
they	0.5
actually	0.5
er	0.5
we	0.5
actually	0.5

take	0.5
off	0.5

was	0.5
not	0.5
the	0.5
best	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
take	0.5
off	0.5
you	0.5
know	0.5
S	0.5
Pretty	0.5
wavering	0.5
and	0.5
uh	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
okay	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
we	0.5
reached	0.5
to	0.5
some	0.5
cruising	0.5
height	0.5
and	0.5
then	0.5
suddenly	0.5
um	0.5
S	0.5
Theres	0.5
announcement	0.5
that	0.5
well	0.5
you	0.5
should	0.5
not	0.5
take	0.5
off	0.5
your	0.5
seat	0.5
belt	0.5

theres	0.5

cant	0.5
go	0.5
to	0.5
the	0.5

S	0.5
And	0.5
we	0.5
had	0.5
to	0.5
just	0.5
sit	0.5
in	0.5
this	0.5
place	0.5
because	0.5
the	0.5
plane	0.5
was	0.5
going	0.5
from	0.5
left	0.5
to	0.5
right	0.5
because	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
er	0.5
turbulence	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
then	0.5
at	0.5
one	0.5
point	0.5
of	0.5
time	0.5
suddenly	0.5
I	0.5
felt	0.5
like	0.5
this	0.5
plane	0.5
was	0.5
falling	0.5
S	0.5
Like	0.5
having	0.5
a	0.5
free	0.5
fall	0.5
you	0.5
know	0.5
how	0.5
in	0.5
turbulence	0.5
sometimes	0.5
it	0.5
falls	0.5
down	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
it	0.5
its	0.5
not	0.5
like	0.5
a	0.5
small	0.5
one	0.5
it	0.5
just	0.5
fell	0.5
down	0.5
for	0.5
like	0.5
300	0.5
400	0.5
feet	0.5
I	0.5
believe	0.5
and	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
suddenly	0.5
the	0.5
lights	0.5
went	0.5
off	0.5
off	0.5
the	0.5
plane	0.5
and	0.5
S	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
just	0.5
free	0.5
falling	0.5
there	0.5
was	0.5
lightning	0.5
outside	0.5
S	0.5
Through	0.5
the	0.5
seat	0.5
these	0.5
flashes	0.5
of	0.5

coming	0.5
in	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
just	0.5
really	0.5
from	0.5
a	0.5
horror	0.5
movie	0.5
or	0.5
something	0.5
its	0.5
really	0.5
scary	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
then	0.5
all	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
sudden	0.5
these	0.5
oxygen	0.5
masks	0.5
drop	0.5
off	0.5

And	0.5
were	0.5
asked	0.5
