hurt	0.5
doing	0.5
this	0.5
at	0.5
some	0.5
point	0.5
in	0.5
time	0.5
like	0.5
cause	0.5
what	0.5
happened	0.5
is	0.5
we	0.5
rolled	0.5
this	0.5
thing	0.5
to	0.5
the	0.5
top	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
hill	0.5
I	0.5
sat	0.5
in	0.5
it	0.5
and	0.5
normally	0.5
we	0.5
would	0.5
just	0.5
let	0.5
going	0.5
down	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
a	0.5
path	0.5
speed	0.5
but	0.5
what	0.5
happened	0.5
this	0.5
time	0.5
was	0.5
she	0.5
really	0.5
S	0.5
like	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
in	0.5
and	0.5
then	0.5
she	0.5
pretty	0.5
pushed	0.5
it	0.5
like	0.5
really	0.5
hard	0.5
so	0.5
then	0.5
I	0.5
started	0.5
to	0.5
go	0.5
down	0.5
with	0.5
speed	0.5
Im	0.5
like	0.5
hanging	0.5
on	0.5
and	0.5
the	0.5
thing	0.5
is	0.5
bobbling	0.5
what	0.5
happened	0.5
is	0.5
the	0.5
thing	0.5
eventually	0.5
curved	0.5
and	0.5
flipped	0.5
over	0.5
kinda	0.5
S	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
stuck	0.5
in	0.5
it	0.5
still	0.5
so	0.5
its	0.5
like	0.5
my	0.5
top	0.5
half	0.5
was	0.5
out	0.5
and	0.5
bottom	0.5
was	0.5
still	0.5
stuck	0.5
in	0.5
the	0.5
thing	0.5
kinda	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
couldnt	0.5
get	0.5
out	0.5
so	0.5
what	0.5
happened	0.5
was	0.5
I	0.5
kinda	0.5
like	0.5
landed	0.5
on	0.5
my	0.5

and	0.5
like	0.5
L	0.5
hm	0.5
uh	0.5
inaudible	0.5
S	0.5
down	0.5
the	0.5
side	0.5
of	0.5
my	0.5

it	0.5
wasnt	0.5
great	0.5
let	0.5
me	0.5
tell	0.5
you	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
really	0.5
painful	0.5
and	0.5
like	0.5
S	0.5
down	0.5
the	0.5
side	0.5
of	0.5
my	0.5
arm	0.5
and	0.5
it	0.5
got	0.5
very	0.5
bloody	0.5
really	0.5

my	0.5
youth	0.5
S	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
a	0.5
so	0.5

thing	0.5
as	0.5
time	0.5
went	0.5
on	0.5
I	0.5
got	0.5
to	0.5
learn	0.5
that	0.5
she	0.5
was	0.5
eventually	0.5
moving	0.5
away	0.5
so	0.5
Id	0.5
known	0.5
her	0.5
for	0.5
like	0.5
couple	0.5
of	0.5
months	0.5
now	0.5
and	0.5
she	0.5
was	0.5
my	0.5
S	0.5
first	0.5
real	0.5
friend	0.5
in	0.5
Sweden	0.5
kinda	0.5
inaudible	0.5
spoke	0.5
English	0.5
to	0.5
me	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
amazing	0.5
I	0.5
didnt	0.5
know	0.5
any	0.5
Swedish	0.5
inaudible	0.5
time	0.5
uh	0.5
but	0.5
I	0.5
got	0.5
to	0.5
know	0.5
she	0.5
was	0.5
moving	0.5
away	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
actually	0.5
S	0.5
her	0.5
family	0.5
was	0.5
moving	0.5
to	0.5
Asia	0.5
kinda	0.5
cause	0.5
her	0.5
dad	0.5
had	0.5
gotten	0.5
a	0.5
job	0.5
there	0.5
um	0.5
so	0.5
basically	0.5
she	0.5
told	0.5
me	0.5
that	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
very	0.5
upset	0.5
and	0.5
S	0.5
like	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
worried	0.5
about	0.5
being	0.5
alone	0.5
cause	0.5
she	0.5
was	0.5
my	0.5
only	0.5
real	0.5
friend	0.5
its	0.5
like	0.5
it	0.5
wasnt	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
difficult	0.5
um	0.5
S	0.5
so	0.5
we	0.5
agreed	0.5
to	0.5
exchange	0.5
each	0.5
others	0.5
phone	0.5
numbers	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
cause	0.5
this	0.5
was	0.5
in	0.5
a	0.5
time	0.5
before	0.5
Facebook	0.5
Instagram	0.5
and	0.5
stuff	0.5
like	0.5
that	0.5
laughs	0.5
which	0.5
S	0.5
yeah	0.5
so	0.5
we	0.5
exchange	0.5
phone	0.5
numbers	0.5
and	0.5
inaudible	0.5
but	0.5
it	0.5
didnt	0.5
really	0.5
work	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
for	0.5
whatever	0.5
reason	0.5
we	0.5
couldnt	0.5
get	0.5
in	0.5
touch	0.5
with	0.5
each	0.5
others	0.5
nothing	0.5
worked	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
so	0.5
yeah	0.5
was	0.5
a	0.5
bit	0.5
S	0.5
unfortunate	0.5
I	0.5
lost	0.5
contact	0.5
with	0.5
her	0.5
for	0.5
a	0.5
couple	0.5
of	0.5
years	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
very	0.5
sad	0.5
in	0.5
the	0.5
beginning	0.5
I	0.5
got	0.5
over	0.5
it	0.5
eventually	0.5
but	0.5
it	0.5
wasnt	0.5
great	0.5
for	0.5
me	0.5
for	0.5
a	0.5
long	0.5
time	0.5
S	0.5
uh	0.5
eventually	0.5
she	0.5
did	0.5
come	0.5
back	0.5
to	0.5
contact	0.5
with	0.5
me	0.5
like	0.5
I	0.5
think	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
five	0.5
years	0.5
later	0.5
or	0.5
something	0.5
like	0.5
Facebook	0.5
suddenly	0.5
like	0.5
a	0.5
message	0.5
like	0.5
uh	0.5
how	0.5
you	0.5
doing	0.5
you	0.5
remember	0.5
me	0.5
S	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
like	0.5
yeah	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
like	0.5
wow	0.5
inaudible	0.5
shes	0.5
back	0.5
uh	0.5
so	0.5
we	0.5
talked	0.5
a	0.5
bit	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
and	0.5
we	0.5
uh	0.5
kind	0.5
started	0.5
to	0.5
share	0.5
to	0.5
talk	0.5
a	0.5
bit	0.5
about	0.5
our	0.5
past	0.5
S	0.5
so	0.5
we	0.5
talked	0.5
about	0.5
the	0.5
stuff	0.5
we	0.5
did	0.5
uh	0.5
and	0.5
we	0.5
talked	0.5
quite	0.5
a	0.5
lot	0.5
about	0.5
nostalgic	0.5
things	0.5
but	0.5
like	0.5
as	0.5
we	0.5
talked	0.5
like	0.5
a	0.5
realized	0.5
she	0.5
was	0.5
getting	0.5
less	0.5
and	0.5
less	0.5
interested	0.5
like	0.5
she	0.5
would	0.5
have	0.5
shorter	0.5
and	0.5
shorter	0.5
responses	0.5
S	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
itd	0.5
take	0.5
longer	0.5
and	0.5
longer	0.5
to	0.5
get	0.5
a	0.5
response	0.5
like	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
enthusiastic	0.5
but	0.5
she	0.5
was	0.5
obviously	0.5
had	0.5
changed	0.5
her	0.5
thoughts	0.5
since	0.5
she	0.5
moved	0.5
uh	0.5
so	0.5
eventually	0.5
as	0.5
S	0.5
time	0.5
went	0.5
on	0.5
we	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
lost	0.5
contact	0.5
which	0.5
is	0.5
sad	0.5
like	0.5
how	0.5
people	0.5
grow	0.5
up	0.5
laughs	0.5
and	0.5
change	0.5
L	0.5
yeah	0.5
yeah	0.5
S	0.5
time	0.5
went	0.5
on	0.5
we	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
lost	0.5
contact	0.5
which	0.5
is	0.5
sad	0.5
like	0.5
how	0.5
people	0.5
grow	0.5
up	0.5
laughs	0.5
and	0.5
change	0.5
S	0.5
time	0.5
went	0.5
on	0.5
we	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
lost	0.5
contact	0.5
which	0.5
is	0.5
sad	0.5
like	0.5
how	0.5
people	0.5
grow	0.5
up	0.5
laughs	0.5
and	0.5
change	0.5
S	0.5
and	0.5
uh	0.5
yeah	0.5
so	0.5
overtime	0.5
we	0.5
just	0.5
stopped	0.5
