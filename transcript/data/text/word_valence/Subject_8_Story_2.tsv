the	0.39999999999999997
teacher	0.39999999999999997
really	0.4
just	0.3499999999999999
tore	0.2999999999999999
into	0.2999999999999999
my	0.2999999999999999

comments	0.2999999999999999
like	0.2999999999999999
she	0.2999999999999999
was	0.2999999999999999
really	0.2999999999999999
sitting	0.2999999999999999
there	0.2999999999999999
this	0.2999999999999999
is	0.2999999999999999
awful	0.2999999999999999
why	0.2999999999999999
would	0.2999999999999999
you	0.2999999999999999
say	0.2999999999999999
this	0.2999999999999999
why	0.2999999999999999
did	0.2999999999999999
you	0.2999999999999999
do	0.2999999999999999
this	0.2999999999999999
you	0.2999999999999999
need	0.2999999999999999
to	0.2999999999999999
speak	0.2999999999999999
louder	0.2999999999999999
kind	0.2999999999999999
of	0.2999999999999999
thing	0.2999999999999999
S	0.2999999999999999
and	0.2999999999999999
I	0.2999999999999999
did	0.3714285714285714
not	0.24999999999999994
take	0.19999999999999998
this	0.2
right	0.19999999999999998
to	0.1
be	0.1
honest	0.5
I	0.5
basically	0.5
was	0.5
reduced	0.5
to	0.5
tears	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
got	0.5
home	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
talked	0.5
to	0.5
my	0.5
parents	0.5
kinda	0.5
and	0.5
we	0.5
talked	0.5
with	0.5
the	0.5
S	0.5
school	0.5
kinda	0.5
of	0.5
can	0.5
we	0.5
get	0.5
rid	0.5
of	0.5
this	0.5
teacher	0.5
shes	0.5
obviously	0.5
just	0.5
an	0.5
awful	0.5
person	0.5
kinda	0.5
can	0.5
we	0.5
do	0.5
something	0.5
about	0.5
this	0.5
and	0.5
the	0.5
school	0.5
said	0.5
no	0.5
I	0.5
mean	0.5
shes	0.5
on	0.5
a	0.5
bunch	0.5
of	0.5
boards	0.5
like	0.5
we	0.5
cant	0.5
really	0.5
get	0.5
rid	0.5
of	0.5
her	0.5
shes	0.5
very	0.5
like	0.5
S	0.5
important	0.5
then	0.5
we	0.5
discussed	0.5
with	0.5
the	0.5
school	0.5
is	0.5
there	0.5
anything	0.5
that	0.5
we	0.5
can	0.5
do	0.5
kinda	0.5
cause	0.5
I	0.5
really	0.5
just	0.5
couldnt	0.5
stand	0.5
this	0.5
teacher	0.5
anymore	0.5
she	0.5
was	0.5
just	0.5
too	0.5
much	0.5
for	0.5
me	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
essentially	0.5
she	0.5
was	0.5
very	0.5
traumatic	0.5
to	0.5
be	0.5
around	0.5
essentially	0.5
S	0.5
and	0.5
inaudible	0.5
as	0.5
a	0.5
kid	0.5
um	0.5
so	0.5
we	0.5
um	0.5
so	0.5
because	0.5
the	0.5
other	0.5
local	0.5
high	0.5
school	0.5
she	0.5
shared	0.5
a	0.5
lot	0.5
of	0.5
courses	0.5
with	0.5
this	0.5
music	0.5
school	0.5
we	0.5
essentially	0.5
arranged	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
could	0.5
just	0.5
S	0.5
transfer	0.5
into	0.5
program	0.5
at	0.5
the	0.5
local	0.5
high	0.5
school	0.5
instead	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
musical	0.5
school	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
could	0.5
still	0.5
get	0.5
my	0.5
exam	0.5
without	0.5
needing	0.5
all	0.5
this	0.5
special	0.5
music	0.5
courses	0.5
as	0.5
they	0.5
normally	0.5
required	0.5
uh	0.5
and	0.5
then	0.5
I	0.5
would	0.5
transfer	0.5
S	0.5
away	0.5
from	0.5
the	0.5
musical	0.5
school	0.5
essentially	0.5
into	0.5
a	0.5
more	0.5
technical	0.5
class	0.5
which	0.5
my	0.5
parents	0.5
were	0.5
happy	0.5
about	0.5
but	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
obviously	0.5
like	0.5
less	0.5
enthusiastic	0.5
about	0.5
essentially	0.5
um	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
did	0.5
eventually	0.5
finish	0.5
S	0.5
finished	0.5
high	0.5
school	0.5
there	0.5
in	0.5
this	0.5
technical	0.5
subject	0.5
kinda	0.5
of	0.5
uh	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
continued	0.5
that	0.5
to	0.5
college	0.5
but	0.5
the	0.5
thing	0.5
was	0.5
when	0.5
I	0.5
