think	0.0
she	0.0
was	0.0
like	0.0
a	0.0
demon	0.0
in	0.0
the	0.0
shape	0.0
of	0.0
a	0.0

she	0.0
was	0.0
really	0.0
bad	0.0

S	0.0
And	0.0
she	0.0
really	0.0
was	0.0
very	0.0
mean	0.13999999999999999
and	0.2
she	0.2
used	0.2
to	0.2

by	0.2
the	0.2
ears	0.2
kind	0.2
of	0.2999999999999999
L	0.2999999999999999
Hmm	0.2999999999999999
S	0.2999999999999999
So	0.2999999999999999
it	0.2999999999999999
was	0.2999999999999999
like	0.39999999999999997
half	0.39999999999999997
abusive	0.39999999999999997
in	0.39999999999999997
some	0.39999999999999997
sense	0.39999999999999997
er	0.39999999999999997
S	0.39999999999999997
So	0.39999999999999997
that	0.39999999999999997
was	0.39999999999999997
really	0.39999999999999997
bad	0.39999999999999997
and	0.39999999999999997
I	0.39999999999999997
really	0.39999999999999997
hated	0.39999999999999997
her	0.39999999999999997
S	0.4
But	0.4
I	0.4
did	0.3499999999999999
actually	0.2999999999999999
meet	0.2999999999999999
some	0.2999999999999999
friends	0.2999999999999999
who	0.2
also	0.2
went	0.2
to	0.2
her	0.2
classes	0.2
S	0.19999999999999998
Who	0.19999999999999998
also	0.19999999999999998
like	0.19999999999999998
we	0.1
kind	0.0
of	0.0
united	0.0
around	0.0
hating	0.0
this	0.0
particular	0.0
teacher	0.0
S	0.0
So	0.0
we	0.0
used	0.0

hang	0.0
out	0.0
and	0.0
talk	0.0
about	0.0
that	0.0
quite	0.0
a	0.0

S	0.0
So	0.0
thats	0.0
a	0.0
there	0.0
was	0.0
a	0.0
bonus	0.0
there	0.0
at	0.0
least	0.0
laughs	0.0
L	0.0
Yeah	0.0
laughs	0.0
S	0.0
Um	0.0

S	0.0
Yeah	0.0
the	0.09999999999999999
school	0.19999999999999998
is	0.19999999999999998
really	0.21666666666666665
good	0.2999999999999999
and	0.2999999999999999
I	0.2999999999999999
enjoyed	0.25714285714285706
being	0.19999999999999998
there	0.19999999999999998
S	0.2
Except	0.2
for	0.2
the	0.1625
class	0.1
cause	0.1
being	0.1
with	0.1
that	0.1
one	0.1
class	0.1
was	0.1
really	0.1
hell	0.125
S	0.2
And	0.2
that	0.2
class	0.2
was	0.2
very	0.2
important	0.2
cause	0.2
they	0.2
actually	0.2
needed	0.2
for	0.2
your	0.2
exams	0.2
S	0.2
So	0.2
at	0.2
the	0.19999999999999998
end	0.2
of	0.2
the	0.2
first	0.19999999999999998

We	0.2999999999999999
had	0.2999999999999999
to	0.2999999999999999
give	0.2999999999999999

mandatory	0.2999999999999999
presentation	0.2999999999999999

S	0.2999999999999999
And	0.2999999999999999
I	0.2999999999999999
was	0.2999999999999999
very	0.2999999999999999
scared	0.2999999999999999
cause	0.2999999999999999
I	0.2999999999999999
was	0.2999999999999999
still	0.2999999999999999
fairly	0.2999999999999999
introverted	0.24999999999999992
back	0.19999999999999998
in	0.19999999999999998

sensitive	0.2999999999999999
at	0.2999999999999999
the	0.2999999999999999
time	0.19999999999999998
so	0.19999999999999998
S	0.19999999999999998
I	0.19999999999999998
really	0.15
didnt	0.5
laughs	0.5
know	0.5
what	0.5
to	0.5
do	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
I	0.5
went	0.5
home	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
told	0.5
my	0.5
parents	0.5
about	0.5
this	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
then	0.5
we	0.5
talked	0.5
to	0.5
the	0.5
school	0.5
about	0.5
it	0.5
to	0.5
see	0.5
if	0.5
we	0.5
could	0.5
do	0.5
something	0.5
S	0.5
Cause	0.5
I	0.5
really	0.5
just	0.5
cant	0.5
deal	0.5
with	0.5
this	0.5
teacher	0.5
anymore	0.5
I	0.5
cant	0.5
have	0.5
her	0.5
for	0.5
another	0.5
two	0.5
years	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
so	0.5
we	0.5
talked	0.5
about	0.5
it	0.5
with	0.5
the	0.5
school	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
they	0.5
said	0.5
no	0.5
we	0.5
cant	0.5
really	0.5
get	0.5
rid	0.5
of	0.5
her	0.5
shes	0.5
a	0.5
very	0.5
important	0.5
person	0.5
S	0.5
Kind	0.5
of	0.5
shes	0.5
on	0.5
a	0.5
number	0.5
of	0.5
steering	0.5
boards	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
she	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
gets	0.5
away	0.5
with	0.5
what	0.5
she	0.5
wants	0.5
in	0.5
some	0.5
sense	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
even	0.5
though	0.5
they	0.5
had	0.5
trouble	0.5
with	0.5
her	0.5
before	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
the	0.5
solution	0.5
was	0.5
essentially	0.5
we	0.5
came	0.5
up	0.5
with	0.5
was	0.5
S	0.5
Was	0.5
unfortunately	0.5
that	0.5
I	0.5
hate	0.5
to	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
inaudible	0.5
S	0.5
The	0.5
school	0.5
shared	0.5
a	0.5
lot	0.5
of	0.5
courses	0.5
with	0.5
the	0.5
normal	0.5
high	0.5
school	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
I	0.5
could	0.5
transfer	0.5
into	0.5
the	0.5
normal	0.5
high	0.5
school	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
and	0.5
complete	0.5
my	0.5
courses	0.5

was	0.5
unfortunate	0.5
for	0.5
me	0.5

stuff	0.5
but	0.5
at	0.5

like	0.5
I	0.5
got	0.5
to	0.5

cause	0.5
she	0.5

my	0.5
life	0.5
miserable	0.5
