for	0.0
me	0.0
S	0.0
all	0.0
the	0.0

S	0.0
Quite	0.0
recently	0.0
actually	0.0
a	0.0

of	0.0
weeks	0.0
back	0.0
I	0.0
was	0.0
traveling	0.0
to	0.0
Brussels	0.0
S	0.0
Normally	0.0
I	0.0
would	0.0
take	0.0
the	0.0

because	0.0
Its	0.0
not	0.0
that	0.0
far	0.0

this	0.0
good	0.0
deal	0.0
on	0.0
this	0.0
website	0.07142857142857142
so	0.35
I	0.39999999999999997
could	0.39999999999999997
take	0.39999999999999997
a	0.4
flight	0.39999999999999997
really	0.39999999999999997
cheap	0.4
S	0.4
And	0.39999999999999997
what	0.39999999999999997
I	0.2999999999999999
didnt	0.2999999999999999
realize	0.2999999999999999
that	0.2999999999999999
was	0.2999999999999999
a	0.2999999999999999
evening	0.2999999999999999
flight	0.2999999999999999
A	0.2999999999999999
evening	0.2999999999999999
flight	0.2999999999999999
is	0.2999999999999999
fine	0.2999999999999999
but	0.2999999999999999
It	0.2999999999999999
was	0.2999999999999999
like	0.2999999999999999
ten	0.2999999999999999
or	0.2999999999999999
something	0.2999999999999999
S	0.2999999999999999
And	0.2999999999999999
you	0.2999999999999999
know	0.2999999999999999
like	0.2999999999999999
er	0.2999999999999999
It	0.2999999999999999
was	0.2999999999999999
sort	0.2999999999999999
of	0.2999999999999999
the	0.2999999999999999
last	0.2999999999999999
flight	0.2999999999999999
of	0.2999999999999999
the	0.2999999999999999
day	0.2999999999999999
or	0.2999999999999999
something	0.2999999999999999
S	0.2999999999999999
So	0.2999999999999999
I	0.3714285714285714
went	0.39999999999999997
to	0.39999999999999997
the	0.41428571428571426
airport	0.5
a	0.5
couple	0.5
of	0.5
hours	0.5
earlier	0.5
than	0.5
the	0.5
boarding	0.5
time	0.5
as	0.5
I	0.5
normally	0.5
do	0.5
S	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
this	0.5
stormy	0.5
evening	0.5
kind	0.5
like	0.5
raining	0.5
and	0.5
really	0.5
dark	0.5
S	0.5
As	0.5
I	0.5
reached	0.5
the	0.5
airport	0.5
I	0.5
see	0.5
this	0.5
long	0.5
queue	0.5
for	0.5
check	0.5
in	0.5
S	0.5
Apparently	0.5
most	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
flights	0.5
were	0.5
delayed	0.5
that	0.5
day	0.5
and	0.5
this	0.5
airport	0.5
was	0.5
full	0.5
of	0.5
people	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
really	0.5
so	0.5
crowded	0.5
L	0.5
Um	0.5
S	0.5
Apparently	0.5
most	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
flights	0.5
were	0.5
delayed	0.5
that	0.5
day	0.5
and	0.5
this	0.5
airport	0.5
was	0.5
full	0.5
of	0.5
people	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
really	0.5
so	0.5
crowded	0.5
S	0.5
Apparently	0.5
most	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
flights	0.5
were	0.5
delayed	0.5
that	0.5
day	0.5
and	0.5
this	0.5
airport	0.5
was	0.5
full	0.5
of	0.5
people	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
really	0.5
so	0.5
crowded	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
took	0.5
me	0.5
a	0.5
long	0.5
for	0.5
the	0.5
check	0.5
in	0.5
to	0.5
happen	0.5
even	0.5
though	0.5
I	0.5
reached	0.5
like	0.5
two	0.5
hours	0.5
before	0.5
the	0.5
time	0.5
S	0.5
Ah	0.4285714285714285
So	0.39999999999999997
I	0.39999999999999997
could	0.39999999999999997
barely	0.39999999999999997
manage	0.3571428571428571
to	0.23333333333333328
get	0.19999999999999998
to	0.19999999999999998
the	0.19999999999999998
boarding	0.19999999999999998
before	0.19999999999999998
they	0.19999999999999998
close	0.19999999999999998
the	0.19999999999999998
boarding	0.19999999999999998
like	0.19999999999999998
ten	0.19999999999999998
minutes	0.19999999999999998
before	0.19999999999999998
they	0.19999999999999998
close	0.19999999999999998
the	0.19999999999999998
boarding	0.19999999999999998
S	0.1888888888888889
Um	0.005555555555555556
S	0.0
So	0.0
I	0.0
went	0.0
in	0.0
I	0.0
inaudible	0.0
to	0.0
board	0.0
S	0.0
You	0.0
know	0.0
normally	0.0
some	0.0
airport	0.0
they	0.0
dont	0.0
have	0.0
this	0.0
bridge	0.0
to	0.0
the	0.0
flight	0.0
then	0.0
you	0.0
have	0.0
to	0.0
take	0.0
the	0.0
bus	0.0
to	0.0
the	0.0
flight	0.0
S	0.0
It	0.0
was	0.0
that	0.0
and	0.0
I	0.0
hate	0.0
that	0.0
actually	0.0
inaudible	0.0
just	0.0
go	0.0
to	0.0
the	0.0
bridge	0.0
S	0.0
But	0.0
we	0.0
took	0.0
the	0.0
bus	0.0
and	0.0
when	0.0
we	0.0
reached	0.0
the	0.0
plane	0.0
I	0.0
see	0.0
that	0.0
is	0.0
not	0.0
a	0.0
big	0.0
plane	0.0
It	0.0
is	0.5
this	0.5
small	0.5
seventy	0.5
seat	0.5
propeller	0.5
plane	0.5
So	0.5
S	0.5
This	0.5
propeller	0.5
plane	0.5
I	0.5
hate	0.5
those	0.5
planes	0.5
I	0.5
fell	0.5
really	0.5
unsafe	0.5
in	0.5
those	0.5
planes	0.5
because	0.5
well	0.5
this	0.5
is	0.5
propellers	0.5
I	0.5
like	0.5
to	0.5
think	0.5
the	0.5
jets	0.5
are	0.5
a	0.5
little	0.5
more	0.5
secure	0.5
I	0.5
think	0.5
I	0.5
fell	0.5
that	0.5
way	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
anyway	0.5
we	0.5
were	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
like	0.5
the	0.5
flight	0.5
was	0.5
getting	0.5
late	0.5
so	0.5
we	0.5
were	0.5
forced	0.5
to	0.5
board	0.5
as	0.5
quickly	0.5
as	0.5
possible	0.5
and	0.5
sit	0.5
down	0.5
S	0.5
Because	0.5
they	0.5
wanted	0.5
to	0.5
prepare	0.5
things	0.5
and	0.5
leave	0.5
in	0.5
time	0.5
ah	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
as	0.5
It	0.5
turns	0.5
out	0.5
when	0.5
the	0.5
time	0.5
actually	0.5
was	0.5
there	0.5
for	0.5
the	0.5
plane	0.5
to	0.5
start	0.5
S	0.5
There	0.5
was	0.5
an	0.5
announcement	0.5
saying	0.5
that	0.5
the	0.5
air	0.5
traffic	0.5
control	0.5
has	0.5
told	0.5
us	0.5
to	0.5
not	0.5
flight	0.5
for	0.5
now	0.5
because	0.5
there	0.5
was	0.5
flights	0.5
before	0.5
us	0.5
we	0.5
were	0.5
late	0.5
and	0.5
S	0.5
It	0.5
is	0.5
stormy	0.5
so	0.5
Its	0.5
better	0.5
wise	0.5
we	0.5
be	0.5
doing	0.5
not	0.5
to	0.5
fly	0.5
at	0.5
that	0.5
particular	0.5
time	0.5
so	0.5
we	0.5
sat	0.5
and	0.5
just	0.5
had	0.5
to	0.5
wait	0.5
S	0.5
Ya	0.5
They	0.5
were	0.5
literally	0.5
forcing	0.5
us	0.5
to	0.5
seat	0.5
down	0.5
now	0.5
now	0.5
inaudible	0.5
we	0.5
had	0.5
to	0.5
wait	0.5
for	0.5
some	0.5
time	0.5
inaudible	0.5
S	0.5
The	0.5
staff	0.5
was	0.5
really	0.5
rude	0.5
at	0.5
that	0.5
time	0.5
S	0.5
Uh	0.5
turns	0.5
out	0.5
we	0.5
stayed	0.5
for	0.5
one	0.5
hour	0.5
at	0.5
the	0.5
tarmac	0.5
waiting	0.5
for	0.5
the	0.5
flight	0.5
to	0.5
take	0.5
off	0.5
because	0.5
they	0.5
just	0.5
not	0.5
move	0.5
And	0.5
they	0.5
dont	0.5
even	0.5
switched	0.5
on	0.5
the	0.5
air	0.5
conditioning	0.5
while	0.5
the	0.5
flight	0.5
was	0.5
not	0.5
started	0.5
S	0.5
Cant	0.5
breath	0.5
properly	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
really	0.5
hot	0.5
inside	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
I	0.5
mean	0.5
outside	0.5
was	0.5
fine	0.5
so	0.5
but	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
really	0.5
hot	0.5
inside	0.5
really	0.5
really	0.5
inaudible	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
get	0.5
really	0.5
claustrophobic	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
do	0.5
not	0.5
like	0.5
those	0.5
places	0.5
S	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
a	0.5
really	0.5
small	0.5
crowded	0.5
plane	0.5
and	0.5
we	0.5
hardly	0.5
had	0.5
space	0.5
to	0.5
move	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
after	0.5
one	0.5
hour	0.5
they	0.5
started	0.5
to	0.5
take	0.5
off	0.5
and	0.5
um	0.5
S	0.5
Its	0.5
not	0.5
even	0.5
the	0.5
smoothest	0.5
take	0.5
off	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
like	0.5
inaudible	0.5
a	0.5
lot	0.5
of	0.5
storm	0.5
so	0.5
a	0.5
lot	0.5
of	0.5
turbulence	0.5
S	0.5
As	0.5
soon	0.5
as	0.5
we	0.5
reached	0.5
the	0.5
cruising	0.5
flight	0.5
I	0.5
would	0.5
normally	0.5
take	0.5
my	0.5
seat	0.5
belt	0.5
because	0.5
I	0.5
wanna	0.5
to	0.5
move	0.5
out	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
wanna	0.5
go	0.5
to	0.5
the	0.5
restroom	0.5
or	0.5
something	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
they	0.5
didnt	0.5
turn	0.5
off	0.5
the	0.5
seat	0.5
belt	0.5
off	0.5
the	0.5
seat	0.5
belt	0.5
signs	0.5
You	0.5
had	0.5
to	0.5
keep	0.5
your	0.5
seat	0.5
belts	0.5
even	0.5
inaudible	0.5
S	0.5
They	0.5
didnt	0.5
allow	0.5
us	0.5
to	0.5
go	0.5
to	0.5
the	0.5
lavatory	0.5
because	0.5
there	0.5
was	0.5
a	0.5
lot	0.5
of	0.5
turbulence	0.5
You	0.5
should	0.5
not	0.5
do	0.5
that	0.5
And	0.5
the	0.5
plane	0.5
after	0.5
some	0.5
time	0.5
started	0.5
to	0.5
move	0.5
from	0.5
left	0.5
to	0.5
right	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
just	0.5
so	0.5
much	0.5
turbulence	0.5
S	0.5
Uh	0.5
um	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
just	0.5
the	0.5
weirdest	0.5
thing	0.5
Ive	0.5
never	0.5
experienced	0.5
this	0.5
thing	0.5
before	0.5
Probably	0.5
the	0.5
storm	0.5
was	0.5
too	0.5
bad	0.5
but	0.5
It	0.5
shouldnt	0.5
be	0.5
that	0.5
bad	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
that	0.5
is	0.5
why	0.5
I	0.5
dont	0.5
like	0.5
small	0.5
planes	0.5
because	0.5
the	0.5
wind	0.5
just	0.5
moves	0.5
it	0.5
around	0.5
completely	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
Turns	0.5
out	0.5
after	0.5
a	0.5
fell	0.5
minutes	0.5
S	0.5
We	0.5
felt	0.5
I	0.5
felt	0.5
like	0.5
the	0.5
plane	0.5
was	0.5
having	0.5
a	0.5
free	0.5
fall	0.5
or	0.5
something	0.5
S	0.5
You	0.5
know	0.5
sometimes	0.5
the	0.5
turbulence	0.5
makes	0.5
it	0.5
falls	0.5
one	0.5
hundred	0.5
feet	0.5
or	0.5
something	0.5
and	0.5
just	0.5
keep	0.5
it	0.5
falling	0.5
And	0.5
I	0.5
felt	0.5
so	0.5
sick	0.5
and	0.5
the	0.5
lights	0.5
were	0.5
turned	0.5
off	0.5
uh	0.5
S	0.5
completely	0.5
and	0.5
everybody	0.5
was	0.5
panicking	0.5
We	0.5
thought	0.5
that	0.5
we	0.5
were	0.5
going	0.5
to	0.5
die	0.5
we	0.5
are	0.5
going	0.5
to	0.5
crash	0.5
or	0.5
something	0.5
because	0.5
ah	0.5
I	0.5
mean	0.5
S	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
just	0.5
weird	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
stormy	0.5
outside	0.5
and	0.5
we	0.5
could	0.5
see	0.5
the	0.5
lightning	0.5
and	0.5
the	0.5
flashes	0.5
coming	0.5
in	0.5
S	0.5
Because	0.5
lights	0.5
inaudible	0.5
really	0.5
scary	0.5
like	0.5
a	0.5
horror	0.5
movie	0.5
or	0.5
something	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
and	0.5
after	0.5
some	0.5
time	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
completely	0.5
falling	0.5
for	0.5
a	0.5
few	0.5
seconds	0.5
and	0.5
suddenly	0.5
the	0.5
oxygen	0.5
masks	0.5
came	0.5
down	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
thats	0.5
when	0.5
I	0.5
thought	0.5
this	0.5
is	0.5
the	0.5
end	0.5
of	0.5
my	0.5
life	0.5
Nothing	0.5
is	0.5
gonna	0.5
work	0.5
for	0.5
now	0.5
S	0.5
The	0.5
oxygen	0.5
masks	0.5
went	0.5
down	0.5
And	0.5
er	0.5
I	0.5
have	0.5
never	0.5
experienced	0.5
this	0.5
before	0.5
Never	0.5
in	0.5
my	0.5
flight	0.5
experience	0.5
I	0.5
had	0.5
to	0.5
wear	0.5
the	0.5
oxygen	0.5
masks	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
because	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
fall	0.5
I	0.5
couldnt	0.5
breath	0.5
because	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
felling	0.5
so	0.5
weird	0.5
for	0.5
me	0.5
Then	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
claustrophobic	0.5
and	0.5
with	0.5
this	0.5
falls	0.5
down	0.5
I	0.5
felt	0.5
really	0.5
odd	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
struggling	0.5
with	0.5
the	0.5
oxygen	0.5
mask	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
couldnt	0.5
put	0.5
it	0.5
on	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
the	0.5
guy	0.5
seating	0.5
next	0.5
to	0.5
me	0.5
helped	0.5
me	0.5
inaudible	0.5
then	0.5
I	0.5
could	0.5
actually	0.5
breath	0.5
after	0.5
that	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
like	0.5
scary	0.5
and	0.5
harrowing	0.5
I	0.5
though	0.5
I	0.5
would	0.5
die	0.5
Even	0.5
before	0.5
the	0.5
flight	0.5
crashes	0.5
if	0.5
it	0.5
does	0.5
I	0.5
would	0.5
just	0.5
die	0.5
with	0.5
a	0.5
lack	0.5
of	0.5
oxygen	0.5
S	0.5
Somehow	0.5
after	0.5
a	0.5
few	0.5
minutes	0.5
a	0.5
couple	0.5
of	0.5
minutes	0.5
the	0.5
flight	0.5
kinds	0.5
of	0.5
stabilize	0.5
and	0.5
the	0.5
falling	0.5
felling	0.5
stop	0.5
for	0.5
some	0.5
time	0.5
S	0.5
Uh	0.5
and	0.5
it	0.5
felt	0.5
like	0.5
the	0.5
flight	0.5
was	0.5
again	0.5
gain	0.5
altitude	0.5
er	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
the	0.5
lights	0.5
came	0.5
on	0.5
again	0.5
and	0.5
the	0.5
airhostess	0.5
says	0.5
that	0.5
we	0.5
had	0.5
this	0.5
terrible	0.5
turbulence	0.5
and	0.5
thats	0.5
why	0.5
it	0.5
happen	0.5
She	0.5
told	0.5
us	0.5
to	0.5
keep	0.5
the	0.5
oxygen	0.5
masks	0.5
for	0.5
some	0.5
time	0.5
before	0.5
we	0.5
reached	0.5
stable	0.5
altitude	0.5
and	0.5
the	0.5
we	0.5
could	0.5
take	0.5
it	0.5
off	0.5
uh	0.5
S	0.5
Uh	0.5
and	0.5
it	0.5
felt	0.5
like	0.5
the	0.5
flight	0.5
was	0.5
again	0.5
gain	0.5
altitude	0.5
er	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
the	0.5
lights	0.5
came	0.5
on	0.5
again	0.5
and	0.5
the	0.5
airhostess	0.5
says	0.5
that	0.5
we	0.5
had	0.5
this	0.5
terrible	0.5
turbulence	0.5

thats	0.5
why	0.5

She	0.5
told	0.5

to	0.5
keep	0.5
the	0.5
oxygen	0.5
masks	0.5
for	0.5
some	0.5

and	0.5
the	0.5
we	0.5
could	0.5
take	0.5
it	0.5
off	0.5
uh	0.5
S	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
just	0.5
weird	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
the	0.5
most	0.5
awful	0.5
thing	0.5
Ive	0.5
ever	0.5
experienced	0.5
S	0.5
Probably	0.5
towards	0.5
when	0.5
we	0.5
were	0.5
reaching	0.5
our	0.5
destination	0.5
the	0.5
flight	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
stabilize	0.5
and	0.5
we	0.5
were	0.5
told	0.5
to	0.5
remove	0.5
the	0.5
oxygen	0.5
masks	0.5
and	0.5
S	0.5
We	0.5
were	0.5
allowed	0.5
to	0.5
raise	0.5
and	0.5
everybody	0.5
was	0.5
panicking	0.5
and	0.5
shaking	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
this	0.5
compact	0.5
small	0.5
plane	0.5
and	0.5
such	0.5
thing	0.5
happened	0.5
we	0.5
couldnt	0.5
move	0.5
much	0.5
um	0.5
S	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
really	0.5
trouble	0.5
something	0.5
Even	0.5
the	0.5
landing	0.5
In	0.5
the	0.5
landing	0.5
we	0.5
bumped	0.5
twice	0.5
before	0.5
we	0.5
actually	0.5
stabilize	0.5
I	0.5
mean	0.5
everything	0.5
that	0.5
could	0.5
go	0.5
wrong	0.5
was	0.5
going	0.5
wrong	0.5
on	0.5
that	0.5
fly	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
so	0.5
scary	0.5
of	0.5
flights	0.5
after	0.5
that	0.5
I	0.5
canceled	0.5
my	0.5
flight	0.5
back	0.5
S	0.5
I	0.5
took	0.5
the	0.5
train	0.5
even	0.5
that	0.5
it	0.5
took	0.5
me	0.5
four	0.5
times	0.5
more	0.5
time	0.5
but	0.5
I	0.5
couldnt	0.5
deal	0.5
with	0.5
the	0.5
whole	0.5
thing	0.5

And	0.5
Im	0.5
pretty	0.5
sure	0.5
Ill	0.5
never	0.5
fly	0.5
in	0.5
this	0.5
small	0.5
planes	0.5
again	0.5
S	0.5
Ill	0.5
check	0.5
before	0.5
what	0.5
plane	0.5
it	0.5
is	0.5
how	0.5
many	0.5
people	0.5
does	0.5
it	0.5
have	0.5
what	0.5

small	0.5
propeller	0.5
planes	0.5
I	0.5

now	0.5
Im	0.5
really	0.5
scary	0.5
