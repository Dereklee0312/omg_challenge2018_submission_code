So	0.0
cool	0.0
where	0.1125
were	0.2
we	0.2
before	0.2
we	0.2
got	0.2
rudely	0.2
interrupted	0.2
ah	0.2
S	0.2
Right	0.19999999999999998
I	0.19999999999999998
was	0.19999999999999998
telling	0.19999999999999998
you	0.2
a	0.19999999999999998
little	0.19999999999999998
bit	0.19999999999999998
about	0.19999999999999998
my	0.2
friend	0.19999999999999998
essentially	0.19999999999999998
she	0.19999999999999998
moved	0.19999999999999998
away	0.19999999999999998
S	0.1
Now	0.1
sometime	0.1
after	0.1
she	0.1
moved	0.1
away	0.1
I	0.1
actually	0.1
started	0.1
to	0.1
get	0.1
more	0.1
into	0.1
music	0.1
S	0.1
Or	0.05
like	0.0
I	0.0

didnt	0.0
listen	0.0
a	0.0
lot	0.1
to	0.15000000000000002
music	0.2
so	0.2599999999999999
I	0.2999999999999999
was	0.2999999999999999
I	0.2999999999999999
guess	0.2999999999999999
interested	0.38
in	0.4
the	0.4
idea	0.4
of	0.4
playing	0.4
an	0.4
instrument	0.4
cause	0.4
I	0.4
thought	0.4
it	0.4
was	0.4
like	0.4
a	0.4
really	0.4
cool	0.4
thing	0.4
like	0.4
would	0.4
be	0.4
a	0.4
rock	0.4
staresque	0.4
kind	0.4
of	0.4
thing	0.4
S	0.4
Um	0.4
so	0.4
I	0.4
pestered	0.4
my	0.4
parents	0.4
for	0.4
this	0.4
S	0.4
Naturally	0.39999999999999997

dont	0.4
really	0.39999999999999997

in	0.2
my	0.19999999999999998

much	0.0
they	0.0
just	0.0
kind	0.0
of	0.0
thought	0.0
it	0.0
was	0.0
a	0.0

would	0.0
go	0.0
over	0.0
S	0.0
Hopefully	0.0

me	0.0
is	0.0
I	0.0
managed	0.0
to	0.0
pester	0.0

given	0.8
by	0.7999999999999999
this	0.8
woman	0.8
who	0.8
was	0.7999999999999999
a	0.8
bit	0.8
evil	0.8
um	0.8
S	0.8
And	0.7999999999999999
I	0.7999999999999999
was	0.7999999999999999
really	0.8
nervous	0.7999999999999999
because	0.7999999999999999
we	0.7999999999999999
were	0.7999999999999999
supposed	0.8
to	0.7999999999999999
give	0.7999999999999999
this	0.7999999999999999
presentation	0.8
around	0.7999999999999999
everybody	0.7999999999999999

of	0.7999999999999999
S	0.8000000000000002
And	0.8
I	0.8
was	0.8000000000000002
partially	0.8
nervous	0.8
because	0.8
I	0.8000000000000002
wanted	0.8
to	0.8
do	0.8000000000000002
a	0.8
good	0.8
job	0.8
get	0.8000000000000002
a	0.8
good	0.8
grade	0.8
S	0.8
And	0.8
partially	0.8
because	0.8
I	0.8
was	0.8
terrified	0.8
of	0.8
getting	0.8
yelled	0.8
at	0.8
essentially	0.8
like	0.8
for	0.8
being	0.8
stupid	0.8
or	0.8250000000000001
whatever	0.5
um	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
I	0.5
did	0.5
prepare	0.5
a	0.5
lot	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
very	0.5
nervous	0.5
I	0.5
did	0.5
manage	0.5
to	0.5
give	0.5
the	0.5
talk	0.5
I	0.5
gave	0.5
the	0.5
presentation	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
I	0.5
thought	0.5
Id	0.5
done	0.5
a	0.5
good	0.5
job	0.5
like	0.5
everyone	0.5
was	0.5
clapping	0.5
S	0.5
But	0.5
then	0.5
like	0.5
she	0.5
really	0.5
laid	0.5
into	0.5
me	0.5
after	0.5
the	0.5
talk	0.5
like	0.5
S	0.5
She	0.5
really	0.5
like	0.5
went	0.5
for	0.5
me	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
laughs	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
pretty	0.5
bad	0.5
like	0.5
breath	0.5
S	0.5
She	0.5
said	0.5
why	0.5
did	0.5
you	0.5
do	0.5
this	0.5
This	0.5
wasnt	0.5
right	0.5
this	0.5
was	0.5
wrong	0.5
you	0.5
shouldve	0.5
said	0.5
this	0.5
you	0.5
need	0.5
to	0.5
speak	0.5
up	0.5
more	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
really	0.5
like	0.5
breath	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
pretty	0.5
devastated	0.5
after	0.5
this	0.5
S	0.5
Cause	0.5
really	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
very	0.5
harsh	0.5
critique	0.5
and	0.5
a	0.5
lot	0.5
of	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
mean	0.5
spirited	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
I	0.5
like	0.5
I	0.5
went	0.5
home	0.5
crying	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
I	0.5
told	0.5
my	0.5
parents	0.5
like	0.5
look	0.5
I	0.5
cant	0.5

of	0.5
the	0.5
courses	0.5
with	0.5
