presentation	0.8
L	0.8
Uhhuh	0.7999999999999999
S	0.8

well	0.8
I	0.8
was	0.8
pretty	0.8
happy	0.8
with	0.8
it	0.8
people	0.8
applauded	0.8
but	0.8
then	0.8
like	0.8
L	0.8
Uhhuh	0.8
yeah	0.8
S	0.8
As	0.8
soon	0.8
as	0.8
I	0.8
was	0.8
done	0.8
like	0.8
the	0.8
teacher	0.8
really	0.8
started	0.8
ripping	0.8
into	0.8
my	0.8
presentation	0.8
its	0.8
like	0.8
S	0.8
And	0.8
this	0.8
was	0.8
wrong	0.8
this	0.8
was	0.8
awful	0.8
why	0.8
did	0.8
you	0.8
say	0.8
this	0.8
this	0.8
was	0.8
just	0.8
not	0.8
right	0.8
S	0.7999999999999999
And	0.7999999999999999
like	0.7999999999999999
I	0.7999999999999999
really	0.7999999999999999
it	0.7999999999999999
was	0.7999999999999999
a	0.7999999999999999
really	0.7999999999999999
hard	0.7999999999999999
blow	0.7999999999999999
kind	0.7999999999999999
of	0.7999999999999999
L	0.7999999999999999
Sure	0.7999999999999999
S	0.8000000000000002
Cause	0.8
I	0.8
was	0.8
a	0.8000000000000002
little	0.8
bit	0.8
I	0.8
wasnt	0.8000000000000002
such	0.8
a	0.8
confident	0.8
person	0.8000000000000002
to	0.8
start	0.8
with	0.8
kind	0.8000000000000002
of	0.8
L	0.8
Sure	0.8
yeah	0.8
S	0.8
So	0.8
its	0.8
like	0.8
the	0.8
fact	0.8
that	0.8
she	0.8
kind	0.8
of	0.8
would	0.8
rip	0.8
into	0.8
something	0.8
that	0.8
Id	0.8
done	0.8
made	0.8
me	0.8
feel	0.8
really	0.8
bad	0.8
L	0.8
Yeah	0.8
yeah	0.8
L	0.8
inaudible	0.8
yeah	0.7999999999999999
S	0.8
laughs	0.8
so	0.7999999999999999
I	0.8
just	0.8
went	0.7999999999999999
home	0.8
to	0.8
my	0.7999999999999999
parents	0.8
and	0.8
I	0.7999999999999999
was	0.8
like	0.8
a	0.7999999999999999
wreck	0.8
kind	0.8
of	0.7999999999999999
S	0.8
Like	0.8
I	0.8
told	0.8
them	0.8
like	0.8
look	0.8
this	0.8
is	0.8
what	0.8
happened	0.8
Im	0.8
really	0.8
unhappy	0.8
can	0.8
I	0.8
go	0.8
do	0.8
something	0.8
about	0.8
this	0.8
L	0.8
Uhhuh	0.8
uhhuh	0.7999999999999999
L	0.8666666666666667
Uhhuh	1.0
S	1.0
Um	1.0
yeah	1.0
so	1.0
my	1.0
parents	1.0
came	1.0
and	1.0
we	1.0
talked	1.0
to	1.0
the	1.0
school	1.0
about	1.0
it	1.0
L	1.0
Uhhuh	1.0
S	1.0
And	1.0
then	1.0
like	1.0
we	1.0
saw	1.0
if	1.0
we	1.0
could	1.0
do	1.0
something	1.0
about	1.0
the	1.0
teacher	1.0
S	1.0
And	1.0
then	1.0
the	1.0
school	1.0
said	1.0
no	1.0
basically	1.0
the	1.0
teacher	1.0
is	1.0
here	1.0
to	1.0
stay	1.0
kind	1.0
of	1.0
S	1.0
We	1.0
cant	1.0
do	1.0
anything	1.0
to	1.0
get	1.0
rid	1.0
of	1.0
them	1.0
kind	1.0
of	1.0
thing	1.0
so	1.0
I	1.0
was	1.0
really	1.0
uncomfortable	1.0
L	1.0
laughs	1.0
oh	1.0
of	1.0
course	1.0
she	0.9
can	0.9
be	0.9
creepy	0.9
that	0.9
way	0.825
S	0.8
Yeah	0.7999999999999999
I	0.8
mean	0.7666666666666666
sometimes	0.6799999999999999
its	0.5999999999999998
like	0.5999999999999999
you	0.5999999999999998
need	0.5999999999999999
uh	0.38333333333333325
with	0.2999999999999999
certain	0.2999999999999999
people	0.2999999999999999
S	0.2999999999999999
Cause	0.2999999999999999
she	0.2999999999999999
was	0.2999999999999999
very	0.2999999999999999
important	0.39999999999999997
she	0.4
was	0.4
on	0.39999999999999997
some	0.4
boards	0.4
or	0.39999999999999997
some	0.4
direction	0.4
or	0.39999999999999997
something	0.4
like	0.4
that	0.3833333333333333
so	0.21999999999999997
I	0.2
was	0.19999999999999998
very	0.2
unfortunate	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
okay	0.5
okay	0.5
L	0.5
Uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
we	0.5
couldnt	0.5
really	0.5
get	0.5
rid	0.5
of	0.5
her	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
S	0.5
Uh	0.5
and	0.5
this	0.5
course	0.5
was	0.5
mandatory	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
just	0.5
really	0.5
didnt	0.5
want	0.5
to	0.5
go	0.5
this	0.5
course	0.5
with	0.5
this	0.5
person	0.5
L	0.5
Oh	0.5
thats	0.5
very	0.5
sad	0.5
S	0.5
Uh	0.5
so	0.5
we	0.5
talked	0.5
a	0.5
bit	0.5
and	0.5
we	0.5
came	0.5
to	0.5
the	0.5
conclusion	0.5
that	0.5
we	0.5
would	0.5
still	0.5
be	0.5
okay	0.5
if	0.5
I	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
S	0.5
The	0.5
thing	0.5
we	0.5
could	0.5
do	0.5
because	0.5
the	0.5
normal	0.5
high	0.5
school	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
S	0.5
Had	0.5
a	0.5
lot	0.5
of	0.5
courses	0.5
shared	0.5
with	0.5
this	0.5
music	0.5
school	0.5
so	0.5
that	0.5
I	0.5
could	0.5
transfer	0.5
to	0.5
this	0.5
normal	0.5
high	0.5
school	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
L	0.5
Yeah	0.5
okay	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
then	0.5
just	0.5
keep	0.5
going	0.5
um	0.5
and	0.5
finish	0.5
my	0.5
school	0.5
curriculum	0.5
there	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
wow	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
S	0.5
Which	0.5
was	0.5
I	0.5
thought	0.5
like	0.5
sure	0.5
as	0.5
long	0.5
as	0.5
I	0.5
get	0.5
to	0.5
avoid	0.5
this	0.5
person	0.5
S	0.5
Cause	0.5
like	0.5
I	0.5
dont	0.5
I	0.5
cant	0.5
handle	0.5
this	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
L	0.5
Yeah	0.5
L	0.5
Cause	0.5
you	0.5
are	0.5
intimidated	0.5
by	0.5
by	0.5
her	0.5
S	0.5
Yeah	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
a	0.5
very	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
a	0.5
very	0.5
fragile	0.5
person	0.5
Id	0.5
say	0.5
back	0.5
then	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
it	0.5
wasnt	0.5
great	0.5
for	0.5
me	0.5
to	0.5
have	0.5
to	0.5
deal	0.5
with	0.5
that	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
S	0.5
Especially	0.5
because	0.5
you	0.5
look	0.5
up	0.5
to	0.5
people	0.5
in	0.5
positions	0.5
of	0.5
in	0.5
like	0.5
this	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
er	0.5
L	0.5
Yeah	0.5
yeah	0.5
S	0.5
Teaching	0.5
positions	0.5
essentially	0.5
and	0.5
so	0.5
its	0.5
like	0.5
L	0.5
Yeah	0.5
sure	0.5
S	0.5
When	0.5
you	0.5
any	0.5
criticism	0.5
from	0.5
them	0.5
becomes	0.5
very	0.5
hurtful	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
L	0.5
Uhhuh	0.5
yeah	0.5
yeah	0.5
S	0.5
Uh	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
did	0.5
eventually	0.5
swap	0.5
over	0.5
to	0.5
and	0.5
complete	0.5
my	0.5
high	0.5
school	0.5
curriculum	0.5
in	0.5
this	0.5
high	0.5
school	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
yeah	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
a	0.5
shame	0.5
I	0.5
had	0.5
to	0.5
leave	0.5
but	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
a	0.5
lot	0.5
less	0.5
stressful	0.5
when	0.5
I	0.5
transferred	0.5
over	0.5
to	0.5
the	0.5
normal	0.5
school	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
I	0.5
I	0.5
missed	0.5
out	0.5
on	0.5
some	0.5
friends	0.5
but	0.5
I	0.5
made	0.5
some	0.5
new	0.5
friends	0.5
as	0.5
well	0.5
so	0.5
that	0.5
was	0.5
breath	0.5
S	0.5
A	0.5
bit	0.5
of	0.5
a	0.5
