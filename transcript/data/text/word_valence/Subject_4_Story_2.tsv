what	0.5999999999999999
I	0.5999999999999999
thought	0.5999999999999998
was	0.5999999999999999
a	0.5999999999999999
very	0.5999999999999999
good	0.5999999999999999
presentation	0.6999999999999998
S	0.6999999999999998
And	0.6999999999999998
I	0.6999999999999998
eventually	0.6999999999999998
went	0.6999999999999998
up	0.7
and	0.6999999999999998
gave	0.6999999999999998
the	0.6999999999999998
presentation	0.6999999999999998
in	0.7
front	0.6999999999999998
of	0.6999999999999998
the	0.6999999999999998
class	0.7166666666666665
I	0.7999999999999999
thought	0.7999999999999999
Id	0.7999999999999999
done	0.7999999999999999
very	0.7999999999999999
well	0.7999999999999999
S	0.8
But	0.7999999999999999
then	0.8
I	0.7999999999999999
started	0.7999999999999999
to	0.8
get	0.7999999999999999
feedback	0.7999999999999999
from	0.8
this	0.7999999999999999
teacher	0.7999999999999999
like	0.8
no	0.7999999999999999
this	0.7999999999999999
is	0.8
ridiculous	0.6999999999999998
you	0.6999999999999998
shouldve	0.6999999999999998
done	0.6999999999999998
this	0.6999999999999998
this	0.6999999999999998
wasnt	0.6999999999999998
good	0.6999999999999998
enough	0.6999999999999998
this	0.6999999999999998
was	0.6999999999999998
awful	0.6999999999999998
like	0.6999999999999998
S	0.7
So	0.6999999999999998
I	0.6999999999999998
really	0.6999999999999998
laughs	0.7
ah	0.6999999999999998
that	0.6999999999999998
was	0.6999999999999998
really	0.7
heavy	0.6999999999999998
for	0.6999999999999998
me	0.6999999999999998
S	0.6999999999999998
I	0.6999999999999998
really	0.7833333333333333
inflicted	0.9833333333333334
a	1.0
blow	1.0
on	0.9500000000000001
my	0.9
self	0.9
esteem	0.9
kind	0.9
of	0.9000000000000001
S	0.9
So	0.9
I	0.9
like	0.9
went	0.9
back	0.9
to	0.9
my	0.9
parents	0.9
in	0.9
shambles	0.9
and	0.9
I	0.9
cried	0.9199999999999999
and	1.0
like	1.0
breath	1.0
L	1.0
Ah	1.0
S	1.0
I	1.0
told	1.0
them	1.0
basically	1.0
look	1.0
we	1.0
couldnt	1.0
I	1.0
couldnt	1.0
like	1.0
keep	1.0
going	1.0
and	1.0
being	1.0
at	1.0
the	1.0
school	1.0
and	1.0
having	1.0
to	1.0
deal	1.0
with	1.0
this	1.0
teacher	1.0
kind	1.0
of	1.0
S	1.0
Cause	0.9
I	0.9
had	0.9
to	0.9
have	0.9
her	0.9
for	0.9
another	0.9
two	0.9
years	0.9
or	0.9
something	0.9
it	0.9
was	0.9
ridiculous	0.9
L	0.9
Hmm	0.9
S	0.9
We	0.9
talked	0.9
with	0.9
the	0.9
school	0.9
about	0.9
this	0.9
teacher	0.9
before	0.9
they	0.9
said	0.9
that	0.9
look	0.9
shes	0.9
basically	0.9
there	0.9
to	0.9
stay	0.9
we	0.9
cant	0.9
do	0.9
anything	0.9
about	0.9
it	0.9
S	0.9000000000000001
So	0.9000000000000001
like	0.9000000000000001
uh	0.9000000000000001
it	0.9000000000000001
was	0.9000000000000001
pretty	0.9000000000000001
bad	0.9000000000000001
S	0.9
So	0.9
what	0.9
we	0.9
did	0.8428571428571427
arrange	0.7999999999999999
eventually	0.7999999999999999
is	0.7999999999999999
that	0.7999999999999999
I	0.7999999999999999
could	0.7999999999999999
actually	0.7999999999999999
transfer	0.7999999999999999
back	0.7999999999999999
to	0.7999999999999999
the	0.7999999999999999
normal	0.7999999999999999
high	0.7999999999999999
school	0.7999999999999999
kind	0.7999999999999999
of	0.7999999999999999
S	0.8000000000000002
Where	0.8
they	0.8
had	0.8
because	0.8
they	0.8
shared	0.8
a	0.8
lot	0.8000000000000002
of	0.8
courses	0.8
with	0.8
this	0.8
music	0.8
school	0.5499999999999999
L	0.24999999999999994
Uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
I	0.5
could	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
complete	0.5
the	0.5
rest	0.5
of	0.5
my	0.5
education	0.5
at	0.5
this	0.5
normal	0.5

kind	0.5
of	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
breath	0.5

Transferred	0.5
over	0.5
there	0.5
which	0.5
was	0.5
a	0.5
shame	0.5
