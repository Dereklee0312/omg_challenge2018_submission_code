Uhhuh	0.8
S	0.7999999999999999
And	0.8
we	0.7999999999999999
actually	0.8
bond	0.7999999999999999
over	0.8
hating	0.7999999999999999
this	0.8
teacher	0.8

okay	0.8999999999999999
S	0.9
Yeah	0.9
so	0.8083333333333335
it	0.8000000000000002
went	0.8666666666666668
okay	0.9
like	0.9
S	0.9
Cause	0.9
she	0.9
made	0.9
my	0.9
life	0.9
really	0.9
miserable	0.9
with	0.9
the	0.9
classes	0.9
but	0.9
the	0.9
rest	0.9
of	0.7999999999999999
the	0.6999999999999998
school	0.825
stuff	0.9
was	0.9
kind	0.9
of	0.9
okay	0.9
L	0.9
Uhhuh	0.9
S	0.9
She	0.9199999999999999
did	1.0
have	1.0
other	1.0
courses	1.0
but	1.0
those	1.0
were	1.0
taken	1.0
the	1.0
two	1.0
later	1.0
years	1.0
kind	1.0
of	1.0
L	0.975
Okay	0.9
thats	0.9
nice	0.9
okay	0.9
S	0.9000000000000001
Er	0.9
everything	0.9000000000000001
was	0.9625
kind	1.0
of	1.0
fine	1.0
for	1.0
the	0.9875
first	0.9000000000000001
year	0.8875
kind	0.7
of	0.9375
L	1.0
Uhhuh	1.0
hmm	0.925
S	0.9
Eventually	0.9
we	0.9
got	0.9
to	0.9500000000000001
this	1.0
point	1.0
where	1.0
we	1.0
had	1.0
to	1.0
give	1.0
this	1.0
big	1.0
presentation	1.0
in	1.0
classical	1.0
music	1.0
theory	0.9199999999999999
in	0.9
front	0.9
of	0.9
the	0.9
entire	0.9
class	0.9
L	0.9
Okay	0.9
S	0.9
I	0.9
was	0.9166666666666666
still	1.0
fairly	1.0
shy	1.0
and	0.85
fragile	0.5999999999999998
at	0.5999999999999999
that	0.5999999999999998
point	0.36666666666666664
in	0.5
time	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
difficult	0.5
so	0.5
this	0.5
was	0.5
a	0.5
scary	0.5
enough	0.5
prospect	0.5
of	0.5
just	0.5
presenting	0.5
in	0.5
front	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
entire	0.5
class	0.5
for	0.5
me	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
S	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
a	0.5
bit	0.5
spooky	0.5
L	0.5
How	0.5
many	0.5
students	0.5
were	0.5
there	0.5
S	0.5
Ah	0.5
there	0.5
were	0.5
about	0.5
20	0.5
something	0.5
I	0.5
think	0.5
so	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
Ah	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
till	0.5
a	0.5
sizable	0.5
crowd	0.5
for	0.5
someone	0.5
so	0.5
young	0.5
tho	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
S	0.5
To	0.5
present	0.5
in	0.5
front	0.5
of	0.5
you	0.5
know	0.5
like	0.5
talking	0.5
in	0.5
front	0.5
of	0.5
8	0.5
people	0.5
is	0.5
a	0.5
bit	0.5
errifying	0.5
like	0.5
laughs	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
yeah	0.5
yeah	0.5
yeah	0.5
uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
Ah	0.5
so	0.5
partially	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
scared	0.5
of	0.5
presenting	0.5
in	0.5
front	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
class	0.5
S	0.5
But	0.5
also	0.5
I	0.5
had	0.5
to	0.5
present	0.5
for	0.5
this	0.5
teacher	0.5
who	0.5
Im	0.5
fairly	0.5
sure	0.5
was	0.5
very	0.5
unhinged	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
L	0.5
Ah	0.5
yes	0.5
its	0.5
awful	0.5
S	0.5
Not	0.5
a	0.5
happy	0.5
person	0.5
essentially	0.5
L	0.5
Yeah	0.5
laughs	0.5
okay	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
it	0.5
took	0.5
me	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
I	0.5
prepared	0.5
a	0.5
lot	0.5
for	0.5
this	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
L	0.5
Uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
very	0.5
nervous	0.5
I	0.5
prepared	0.5
a	0.5
lot	0.5
I	0.5
prepared	0.5
slides	0.5
L	0.5
Uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
I	0.5
really	0.5
rehearsed	0.5
in	0.5
front	0.5
of	0.5
a	0.5
mirror	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
to	0.5
make	0.5
sure	0.5
it	0.5
would	0.5
be	0.5
good	0.5
um	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
Eventually	0.5
the	0.5
day	0.5
came	0.5
I	0.5
gave	0.5
the	0.5
presentation	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
fairly	0.5
happy	0.5
with	0.5
it	0.5
L	0.5
Uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
Like	0.5
people	0.5
clapped	0.5
and	0.5
the	0.5
they	0.5
laughed	0.5
in	0.5
between	0.5
the	0.5
presentation	0.5
that	0.5
was	0.5
nice	0.5
L	0.5
Ah	0.5
thats	0.5
nice	0.5
S	0.5
Ah	0.5
but	0.5
then	0.5
the	0.5
teacher	0.5
started	0.5
to	0.5
give	0.5
feedback	0.5
and	0.5
she	0.5
really	0.5
like	0.5
ripped	0.5
into	0.5
my	0.5
whats	0.5
it	0.5
called	0.5
um	0.5
S	0.5
Presentation	0.5
So	0.5
she	0.5
really	0.5
said	0.5
like	0.5
no	0.5
this	0.5
is	0.5
wrong	0.5
this	0.5
is	0.5
awful	0.5
why	0.5
you	0.5
do	0.5
this	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
S	0.5
inaudible	0.5
and	0.5
why	0.5
did	0.5
you	0.5
say	0.5
shouldve	0.5
spoken	0.5
louder	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
really	0.5
just	0.5
like	0.5
mean	0.5
spirited	0.5
uh	0.5
feedback	0.5
S	0.5
Not	0.5
really	0.5
constructive	0.5
at	0.5
all	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
S	0.5
I	0.5
had	0.5
a	0.5
very	0.5
tough	0.5
time	0.5
handling	0.5
this	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
ah	0.5
S	0.5
I	0.5
had	0.5
a	0.5
very	0.5
fragile	0.5
self	0.5
esteem	0.5
at	0.5
that	0.5
point	0.5
in	0.5
time	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
breath	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
S	0.5
Difficult	0.5
for	0.5
me	0.5
to	0.5
parse	0.5
the	0.5
information	0.5
I	0.5
suppose	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
its	0.5
like	0.5
difficult	0.5
for	0.5
me	0.5
to	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
absorb	0.5
that	0.5
L	0.5
Yeah	0.5
of	0.5
course	0.5
uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
essentially	0.5
I	0.5
did	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
just	0.5
go	0.5
home	0.5
to	0.5
my	0.5
parents	0.5
in	0.5
tears	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
I	0.5
like	0.5
to	0.5
tell	0.5
them	0.5
like	0.5
this	0.5
isnt	0.5
gonna	0.5
work	0.5
I	0.5
cant	0.5
deal	0.5
with	0.5
this	0.5
S	0.5
Ah	0.5
we	0.5
had	0.5
to	0.5
go	0.5
and	0.5
talk	0.5
with	0.5
the	0.5
school	0.5
S	0.5
But	0.5
they	0.5
said	0.5
like	0.5
no	0.5
we	0.5
cant	0.5
really	0.5
get	0.5
rid	0.5
of	0.5
her	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
S	0.5
Shes	0.5
on	0.5
a	0.5
number	0.5
of	0.5
boards	0.5
like	0.5
shes	0.5
essentially	0.5
there	0.5
to	0.5
stay	0.5
is	0.5
what	0.5
they	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
said	0.5
L	0.5
Oh	0.5
my	0.5
god	0.5
L	0.5
So	0.5
you	0.5
couldnt	0.5
do	0.5
anything	0.5
about	0.5
it	0.5
either	0.5
S	0.5
No	0.5
she	0.5
was	0.5
a	0.5
she	0.5
was	0.5
a	0.5
permanent	0.5
fixture	0.5
unfortunately	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
there	0.5
was	0.5
scarcely	0.5
more	0.5
we	0.5
could	0.5
do	0.5
but	0.5
she	0.5
also	0.5
held	0.5
a	0.5
bunch	0.5
of	0.5
other	0.5
courses	0.5
essentially	0.5
which	0.5
was	0.5
a	0.5
problem	0.5
L	0.5
Ah	0.5
shit	0.5
uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
Uh	0.5
so	0.5
we	0.5
discussed	0.5
with	0.5
them	0.5
and	0.5
we	0.5
eventually	0.5
came	0.5
to	0.5
a	0.5
solution	0.5
L	0.5
Uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
That	0.5
we	0.5
could	0.5
transfer	0.5
me	0.5
to	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
theres	0.5
a	0.5
high	0.5
school	0.5
which	0.5
shared	0.5
a	0.5
number	0.5
of	0.5
courses	0.5
with	0.5
this	0.5
S	0.5
Uh	0.5
music	0.5
oriented	0.5
school	0.5
and	0.5
we	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
S	0.5
Took	0.5
to	0.5
that	0.5
we	0.5
could	0.5
transfer	0.5
in	0.5
to	0.5
me	0.5
into	0.5
this	0.5
normal	0.5
school	0.5
program	0.5
essentially	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
so	0.5
continue	0.5
my	0.5
education	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
could	0.5
avoid	0.5
these	0.5
mandatory	0.5
music	0.5
courses	0.5
that	0.5
were	0.5
required	0.5
from	0.5
and	0.5
held	0.5
by	0.5
this	0.5
teacher	0.5
L	0.5
Uhhuh	0.5
ah	0.5
okay	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
so	0.5
L	0.5
Yeah	0.5
but	0.5
that	0.5
means	0.5
you	0.5
losing	0.5
studying	0.5
music	0.5
S	0.5
Yeah	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
not	0.5
great	0.5
but	0.5
she	0.5
made	0.5
my	0.5
life	0.5
singularly	0.5
miserable	0.5
S	0.5
I	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
thought	0.5
whats	0.5
it	0.5
called	0.5
I	0.5
can	0.5
get	0.5
back	0.5
into	0.5
it	0.5
later	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
S	0.5
My	0.5
parents	0.5
thought	0.5
yeah	0.5
hes	0.5
going	0.5
to	0.5
study	0.5
IT	0.5
stuff	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
like	0.5
thats	0.5
fine	0.5
as	0.5
well	0.5
right	0.5
laughs	0.5
L	0.5
Yes	0.5
laughs	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
so	0.5
thats	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
what	0.5
happened	0.5
to	0.5
me	0.5
in	0.5
essence	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
I	0.5
transferred	0.5
and	0.5
then	0.5
finished	0.5
a	0.5
normal	0.5
like	0.5
more	0.5
traditional	0.5
thing	0.5
I	0.5
did	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5

cause	0.5
its	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
up	0.5

laughs	0.5
S	0.5
I	0.5
did	0.5
actually	0.5
meet	0.5
one	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
guys	0.5
who	0.5
I	0.5
met	0.5
there	0.5
in	0.5
the	0.5
corridors	0.5
of	0.5

for	0.5
he	0.5
two	0.5
