of	0.09999999999999999
the	0.1
entire	0.09999999999999999
class	0.1
was	0.09999999999999999
a	0.1
problem	0.09999999999999999
S	0.1
And	0.1
then	0.02
the	0.0
fact	0.0
that	0.0
I	0.0
had	0.0
to	0.0
present	0.0
in	0.0
front	0.0
of	0.0
this	0.0
teacher	0.0
which	0.0
I	0.5
was	0.5
just	0.5
terrified	0.5
of	0.5
essentially	0.5
S	0.5
Cause	0.5
she	0.5
was	0.5
just	0.5
evil	0.5
laughs	0.5
um	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
I	0.5
did	0.5
spend	0.5
a	0.5
lot	0.5
of	0.5
time	0.5
like	0.5
practicing	0.5
and	0.5
preparing	0.5
for	0.5
this	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
I	0.5
rehearsed	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
well	0.5
I	0.5
felt	0.5
fairly	0.5
confident	0.5
L	0.5
Uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
I	0.5
went	0.5
up	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
gave	0.5
the	0.5
presentation	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
people	0.5
laughed	0.5
and	0.5
they	0.5
applauded	0.5
when	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
done	0.5
I	0.5
thought	0.5
Id	0.5
done	0.5
a	0.5
really	0.5
good	0.5
job	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
but	0.5
once	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
done	0.5
the	0.5
teacher	0.5
really	0.5
like	0.5
laid	0.5
into	0.5
my	0.5
presentation	0.5
S	0.5
Like	0.5
no	0.5
this	0.5
wrong	0.5
why	0.5
did	0.5
you	0.5
say	0.5
this	0.5
you	0.5
cant	0.5
mean	0.5
this	0.5
why	0.5
did	0.5
you	0.5
do	0.5
this	0.5
S	0.5
Can	0.5
you	0.5
just	0.5
speak	0.5
louder	0.5
Its	0.5
like	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
really	0.5
like	0.5
distraught	0.5
after	0.5
this	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
S	0.5
Cause	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
a	0.5
very	0.5
fragile	0.5
person	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
actually	0.5
had	0.5
to	0.5
go	0.5
like	0.5
I	0.5
basically	0.5
cried	0.5
essentially	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
I	0.5
went	0.5
back	0.5
home	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
told	0.5
my	0.5
parents	0.5
I	0.5
cant	0.5
deal	0.5
with	0.5
this	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
this	0.5
is	0.5
too	0.5
much	0.5
for	0.5
me	0.5
um	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
we	0.5
had	0.5
to	0.5
go	0.5
and	0.5
with	0.5
the	0.5
school	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
see	0.5
if	0.5
we	0.5
could	0.5
do	0.5
anything	0.5
about	0.5
it	0.5
S	0.5
But	0.5
like	0.5
the	0.5
school	0.5
said	0.5
that	0.5
basically	0.5
shes	0.5
on	0.5
a	0.5
bunch	0.5
of	0.5
boards	0.5
we	0.5
cant	0.5
get	0.5
rid	0.5
of	0.5
her	0.5
so	0.5
shes	0.5
basically	0.5
there	0.5
to	0.5
stay	0.5
S	0.5
Ah	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
couldnt	0.5
just	0.5
deal	0.5
with	0.5
her	0.5
anymore	0.5
like	0.5
because	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
a	0.5
mandatory	0.5
course	0.5
S	0.5
Sure	0.5
but	0.5
like	0.5
couldnt	0.5
handle	0.5
her	0.5
for	0.5
another	0.5
two	0.5
years	0.5
er	0.5
L	0.5
Uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
eventually	0.5
we	0.5
discussed	0.5
and	0.5
like	0.5
we	0.5
decided	0.5
to	0.5
send	0.5
me	0.5
to	0.5
like	0.5
S	0.5
This	0.5
musical	0.5
high	0.5
school	0.5
shared	0.5
a	0.5
lot	0.5
of	0.5
courses	0.5
with	0.5
the	0.5
normal	0.5
high	0.5
school	0.5
essentially	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
I	0.5
could	0.5
transfer	0.5
over	0.5
to	0.5
the	0.5
normal	0.5
without	0.5
like	0.5
impacting	0.5
my	0.5
studies	0.5
too	0.5
much	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
my	0.5
parents	0.5
were	0.5
also	0.5
happy	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
back	0.5
to	0.5
a	0.5
more	0.5
technical	0.5
subject	0.5
as	0.5
well	0.5
laughs	0.5
L	0.5
laughs	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
I	0.5
yeah	0.5
I	0.5
eventually	0.5
went	0.5
to	0.5
the	0.5
normal	0.5
high	0.5
school	0.5
and	0.5
finished	0.5
my	0.5
curriculum	0.5
there	0.5
S	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
a	0.5
shame	0.5
I	0.5
couldnt	0.5
finish	0.5
at	0.5
the	0.5
musical	0.5
school	0.5
but	0.5

Yeah	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
I	0.5
did	0.5
actually	0.5
meet	0.5
up	0.5
with	0.5
one	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
guys	0.5
that	0.5
went	0.5
