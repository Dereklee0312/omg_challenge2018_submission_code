mostly	0.0
in	0.0
the	0.0
presentation	0.0
S	0.0
They	0.0
clapped	0.0
when	0.0
I	0.0
was	0.0
done	0.0
I	0.0
felt	0.0
pretty	0.0
good	0.0
about	0.0
it	0.0
S	0.0
But	0.0
then	0.0
when	0.0
I	0.0
was	0.0
done	0.0
this	0.0
teacher	0.0
really	0.0
ripped	0.0
into	0.0
like	0.0
my	0.0
whats	0.0
it	0.0
called	0.0
presentation	0.0
kind	0.0
of	0.0
S	0.0
She	0.0
really	0.0
like	0.0
said	0.0
no	0.0
why	0.0
would	0.0
say	0.0
this	0.0
why	0.0
did	0.0
you	0.0
do	0.0
this	0.0
this	0.0
was	0.0
entirely	0.0
wrong	0.0
kind	0.0
of	0.0
thing	0.0
L	0.0
Hmm	0.0
S	0.0
And	0.0
she	0.0
really	0.0
just	0.0
like	0.0
was	0.0
very	0.0
mean	0.0
and	0.0
like	0.0
uh	0.0
S	0.0
Mean	0.0
about	0.0
it	0.0
like	0.0
the	0.0
feedback	0.0
she	0.0
gave	0.0
essentially	0.0
L	0.0
Uhhuh	0.0
S	0.0
Uh	0.0
and	0.0
that	0.0
kind	0.0
of	0.0
really	0.0
uh	0.0
really	0.0
impacted	0.0
my	0.0
self	0.0
esteem	0.0
kind	0.0
of	0.0
S	0.0
Because	0.0
Im	0.0
a	0.0
very	0.0
fra	0.0
I	0.0
was	0.0
a	0.0
very	0.0
fragile	0.0
person	0.0
back	0.0
inaudible	0.0
L	0.0
Negatively	0.0
S	0.0
Yeah	0.0
it	0.0
very	0.0
negatively	0.0
impacted	0.0
my	0.0
self	0.0
esteem	0.0
kind	0.0
of	0.0
cause	0.0
I	0.0
was	0.0
a	0.0
very	0.0
fragile	0.0
back	0.0
then	0.0
S	0.0
As	0.0
a	0.0
person	0.0
I	0.0
had	0.0
very	0.0
low	0.0
self	0.0
esteem	0.0
still	0.0
at	0.0
that	0.0
time	0.0
S	0.0
So	0.0
it	0.0
was	0.0
very	0.0
difficult	0.0
for	0.0
me	0.0
to	0.0
handle	0.0
that	0.0
kind	0.0
of	0.0
negative	0.0
unfiltered	0.0
feedback	0.0
kind	0.0
of	0.0
S	0.0
Uh	0.0
so	0.0
I	0.0
basically	0.0
returned	0.0
to	0.0
my	0.0
parents	0.0
in	0.0
tears	0.0
kind	0.0
of	0.0
laughs	0.0
S	0.0
And	0.0
told	0.0
them	0.0
like	0.0
look	0.0
uh	0.0
this	0.0
is	0.0
just	0.0
not	0.0
working	0.0
like	0.0
I	0.0
cant	0.0
deal	0.0
with	0.0
this	0.0
teacher	0.0
I	0.0
dont	0.0
want	0.0
to	0.0
S	0.0
Uh	0.0
so	0.0
we	0.0
went	0.0
and	0.0
talked	0.0
with	0.0
the	0.0
school	0.0
but	0.0
the	0.0
school	0.0
said	0.0
they	0.0
cant	0.0
really	0.0
do	0.0
anything	0.0
like	0.0
S	0.0
This	0.0
lady	0.0
she	0.0
theyd	0.0
had	0.0
reports	0.0
about	0.0
her	0.0
before	0.0
S	0.0
But	0.0
shes	0.0
on	0.0
a	0.0
bunch	0.0
of	0.0
boards	0.0
and	0.0
she	0.0
couldnt	0.0
really	0.0
be	0.0
replaced	0.0
that	0.0
easily	0.0
kind	0.0
of	0.0
S	0.0
And	0.0
it	0.0
was	0.0
up	0.0
to	0.0
her	0.0
how	0.0
she	0.0
uh	0.0
her	0.0
class	0.0
and	0.0
stuff	0.0
L	0.0
Hmm	0.0
S	0.0
So	0.0
we	0.0
couldnt	0.0
really	0.0
deal	0.0
much	0.0
about	0.0
that	0.0
S	0.0
But	0.0
the	0.0
course	0.0
was	0.0
still	0.0
mandatory	0.0
so	0.0
its	0.0
like	0.0
S	0.0
Shed	0.0
still	0.0
be	0.0
around	0.0
kind	0.0
of	0.0
and	0.0
she	0.0
made	0.0
peoples	0.0
life	0.0
difficult	0.0
anyway	0.0
even	0.0
when	0.0
they	0.0
werent	0.0
in	0.0
her	0.0
class	0.0
S	0.0
So	0.0
we	0.0
discussed	0.0
possibly	0.0
like	0.0
just	0.0
S	0.0
Uh	0.0
cause	0.0
we	0.0
had	0.0
they	0.0
were	0.0
the	0.0
normal	0.0
high	0.0
school	0.0
also	0.0
shared	0.0
a	0.0
couple	0.0
of	0.0
courses	0.0
with	0.0
this	0.0
uh	0.0
music	0.0
school	0.0
S	0.0
So	0.0
they	0.0
suggested	0.0
that	0.0
we	0.0
could	0.0
transfer	0.0
S	0.0
What	0.0
was	0.0
left	0.0
of	0.0
my	0.0
education	0.0
over	0.0
to	0.0
this	0.0
normal	0.0
high	0.0
school	0.0
kind	0.0
of	0.0
S	0.0
And	0.0
I	0.0
could	0.0
just	0.0
go	0.0
back	0.0
to	0.0
a	0.0
more	0.0
technical	0.0
like	0.0
oriented	0.0
thing	0.0
S	0.0
Where	0.0
I	0.0
wouldnt	0.0
have	0.0
to	0.0
do	0.0
these	0.0
music	0.0
courses	0.0
with	0.0
her	0.0
L	0.0
Hmm	0.0
S	0.0
Ah	0.0
which	0.0
was	0.0
okay	0.0
it	0.0
was	0.0
a	0.0
solution	0.0
kind	0.0
of	0.0
S	0.0
Which	0.0
we	0.0
took	0.0
uh	0.0
it	0.0
wasnt	0.0
it	0.0
wouldve	0.0
been	0.0
better	0.0
if	0.0
I	0.0
couldve	0.0
con	0.0
S	0.0
Or	0.0
I	0.0
wouldve	0.0
been	0.0
happier	0.0
if	0.0
I	0.0
couldve	0.0
continued	0.0
with	0.0
the	0.0
music	0.0
place	0.0
S	0.0
But	0.0
my	0.0
parents	0.0
were	0.0
just	0.0
happy	0.0
that	0.0
I	0.0
can	0.0
switch	0.0
to	0.0
a	0.0
technical	0.0
you	0.0
know	0.0
school	0.0
kind	0.0
of	0.0
S	0.0
My	0.0
parents	0.0
are	0.0
very	0.0
practical	0.0
like	0.0
that	0.0
so	0.0
laughs	0.0
L	0.0
Hmm	0.0
S	0.0
Ah	0.0
it	0.0
was	0.0
unfortunate	0.0
but	0.0
I	0.0
did	0.0
eventually	0.0
finish	0.0
off	0.0
kind	0.0
of	0.0
S	0.0
Graduating	0.0
with	0.0
