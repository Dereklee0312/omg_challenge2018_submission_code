very	0.0
cheap	0.0
so	0.0
I	0.0
took	0.0
it	0.0
it	0.0
was	0.0
night	0.0

S	0.0
It	0.0
was	0.0
a	0.0
night	0.0
flight	0.0
pretty	0.0
much	0.0
I	0.0
think	0.0
the	0.0
last	0.0
flight	0.0
of	0.0
the	0.0
night	0.0
or	0.0
something	0.0
before	0.0
they	0.0
closed	0.0
the	0.0
airport	0.0
L	0.0
Okay	0.0
S	0.0
Um	0.0
so	0.0
I	0.0
reach	0.0
the	0.0
airport	0.0
a	0.0
couple	0.0
of	0.0
hours	0.0
ago	0.0
S	0.0
It	0.0
was	0.0
a	0.0
bit	0.0
raining	0.0
and	0.0
it	0.0
was	0.0
a	0.0
bit	0.0
storming	0.0
so	0.0
I	0.0
thought	0.0
I	0.0
expected	0.0
a	0.0
bit	0.0
of	0.0
delay	0.0
L	0.0
Uhhuh	0.0
S	0.0
So	0.0
I	0.0
reached	0.0
a	0.0
bit	0.0
early	0.0
and	0.0
I	0.0
realized	0.0
as	0.0
soon	0.0
as	0.0
I	0.0
reached	0.0
the	0.0
airport	0.0
S	0.0
That	0.0
Im	0.0
not	0.0
gonna	0.0
reach	0.0
the	0.5
boarding	0.5
S	0.5
Cause	0.5
the	0.5
airport	0.5
was	0.5
full	0.5
of	0.5
people	0.5
S	0.5
The	0.5
check	0.5
in	0.5
queue	0.5
was	0.5
like	0.5
this	0.5
huge	0.5
queue	0.5
L	0.5
Ah	0.5
S	0.5
Uh	0.5
apparently	0.5
all	0.5
the	0.5
flights	0.5
before	0.5
this	0.5
one	0.5
were	0.5
delayed	0.5
because	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
weather	0.5
L	0.5
Hmm	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
just	0.5
jam	0.5
packed	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
somehow	0.5
I	0.5
lurch	0.5
through	0.5
things	0.5
S	0.5
Through	0.5
security	0.5
and	0.5
everything	0.5
I	0.5
just	0.5
barely	0.5
manage	0.5
to	0.5
S	0.5
Reach	0.5
the	0.5
boarding	0.5
gate	0.5
before	0.5
they	0.5
closed	0.5
it	0.5
L	0.5
Hmm	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
I	0.5
think	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
uh	0.5
five	0.5
minutes	0.5
left	0.5
before	0.5
I	0.5
inaudible	0.5
and	0.5
enter	0.5
L	0.5
Ah	0.5
S	0.5
Uh	0.5
and	0.5
then	0.5
I	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
able	0.5
to	0.5
board	0.5
the	0.5
plane	0.5
um	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
uh	0.5
you	0.5
know	0.5
these	0.5
uh	0.5
some	0.5
of	0.5
these	0.5
flights	0.5
dont	0.5
have	0.5
like	0.5
the	0.5
bridge	0.5
to	0.5
the	0.5
to	0.5
the	0.5
plane	0.5
S	0.5
You	0.5
have	0.5
to	0.5
go	0.5
down	0.5
and	0.5
take	0.5
the	0.5
bus	0.5
and	0.5
the	0.5
bus	0.5
goes	0.5
I	0.5
hate	0.5
that	0.5
L	0.5
Yeah	0.5
laughs	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
so	0.5
they	0.5
just	0.5
fill	0.5
you	0.5
up	0.5
in	0.5
this	0.5
bus	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
then	0.5
you	0.5
have	0.5
to	0.5
wait	0.5
at	0.5
the	0.5
tarmac	0.5
for	0.5
some	0.5
time	0.5
L	0.5
Of	0.5
course	0.5
yeah	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
they	0.5
took	0.5
the	0.5
bus	0.5
onto	0.5
the	0.5
plane	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
uh	0.5
what	0.5
I	0.5
see	0.5
is	0.5
actually	0.5
this	0.5
really	0.5
small	0.5
propeller	0.5
plane	0.5
S	0.5
Like	0.5
the	0.5
sixty	0.5
seventy	0.5
seater	0.5
or	0.5
something	0.5
S	0.5
Oh	0.5
S	0.5
Uh	0.5
which	0.5
I	0.5
hate	0.5
a	0.5
lot	0.5
S	0.5
Because	0.5
I	0.5
dont	0.5
really	0.5
trust	0.5
the	0.5
propeller	0.5
planes	0.5
that	0.5
much	0.5
I	0.5
have	0.5
not	0.5
had	0.5
good	0.5
experiences	0.5
with	0.5
it	0.5
L	0.5
laughs	0.5
oh	0.5
S	0.5
Uh	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
normally	0.5
I	0.5
only	0.5
take	0.5
the	0.5
bigger	0.5
flights	0.5
S	0.5
With	0.5
the	0.5
with	0.5
the	0.5
jet	0.5
planes	0.5
so	0.5
that	0.5
uh	0.5
in	0.5
my	0.5
head	0.5
Im	0.5
not	0.5
going	0.5
crazy	0.5
S	0.5
But	0.5
I	0.5
didnt	0.5
have	0.5
an	0.5
option	0.5
here	0.5
because	0.5
I	0.5
didnt	0.5
even	0.5
see	0.5
which	0.5
plane	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
just	0.5
got	0.5
this	0.5
deal	0.5
and	0.5
S	0.5
At	0.5
that	0.5
point	0.5
of	0.5
time	0.5
I	0.5
couldnt	0.5
say	0.5
laughs	0.5
Im	0.5
not	0.5
boarding	0.5
anymore	0.5
because	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
like	0.5
outside	0.5
the	0.5
plane	0.5
L	0.5
Hmm	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
we	0.5
got	0.5
in	0.5
and	0.5
they	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
rushed	0.5
us	0.5
in	0.5
because	0.5
they	0.5
were	0.5
getting	0.5
late	0.5
or	0.5
something	0.5
so	0.5
they	0.5
S	0.5
Pretty	0.5
much	0.5
were	0.5
were	0.5
rude	0.5
and	0.5
just	0.5
pushed	0.5
us	0.5
in	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
then	0.5
they	0.5
said	0.5
yeah	0.5
get	0.5
seated	0.5
as	0.5
soon	0.5
as	0.5
possible	0.5
and	0.5
were	0.5
gonna	0.5
start	0.5
and	0.5
S	0.5
Everything	0.5
we	0.5
sat	0.5
down	0.5
and	0.5
um	0.5
S	0.5
The	0.5
the	0.5
air	0.5
staff	0.5
was	0.5
not	0.5
very	0.5
polite	0.5
I	0.5
would	0.5
say	0.5
S	0.5
They	0.5
were	0.5
just	0.5
pushing	0.5
people	0.5
around	0.5
just	0.5
getting	0.5
them	0.5
seated	0.5
so	0.5
that	0.5
they	0.5
could	0.5
start	0.5
S	0.5
Its	0.5
weird	0.5
um	0.5
probably	0.5
it	0.5
happens	0.5
with	0.5
cheap	0.5
flights	0.5
anyway	0.5
L	0.5
laughs	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
ah	0.5
as	0.5
soon	0.5
as	0.5
we	0.5
all	0.5
ah	0.5
sat	0.5
in	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
then	0.5
we	0.5
were	0.5
ready	0.5
to	0.5
fly	0.5
there	0.5
was	0.5
announcement	0.5
saying	0.5
that	0.5
yeah	0.5
but	0.5
we	0.5
cannot	0.5
take	0.5
off	0.5
right	0.5
now	0.5
S	0.5
Because	0.5
the	0.5
air	0.5
traffic	0.5
control	0.5
has	0.5
told	0.5
us	0.5
that	0.5
theres	0.5
a	0.5
bad	0.5
weather	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
we	0.5
cant	0.5
really	0.5
took	0.5
take	0.5
off	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
can	0.5
you	0.5
imagine	0.5
we	0.5
stayed	0.5
at	0.5
the	0.5
tarmac	0.5
for	0.5
one	0.5
hour	0.5
S	0.5
Waiting	0.5
for	0.5
the	0.5
plane	0.5
to	0.5
take	0.5
off	0.5
L	0.5
Oh	0.5
my	0.5
S	0.5
Which	0.5
is	0.5
weird	0.5
because	0.5
earlier	0.5
they	0.5
were	0.5
just	0.5
pushing	0.5
is	0.5
in	0.5
to	0.5
start	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
now	0.5
we	0.5
had	0.5
to	0.5
sit	0.5
there	0.5
for	0.5
an	0.5
hour	0.5
L	0.5
Yeah	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
like	0.5
you	0.5
know	0.5
they	0.5
dont	0.5
even	0.5
switch	0.5
on	0.5
the	0.5
air	0.5
conditioning	0.5
while	0.5
its	0.5
on	0.5
the	0.5
tarmac	0.5
S	0.5
Er	0.5
just	0.5
you	0.5
couldnt	0.5
breathe	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
just	0.5
getting	0.5
crampy	0.5
and	0.5
just	0.5
so	0.5
bad	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
after	0.5
an	0.5
hour	0.5
we	0.5
actually	0.5
took	0.5
off	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
the	0.5
took	0.5
off	0.5
was	0.5
also	0.5
not	0.5
that	0.5
great	0.5
S	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
like	0.5
this	0.5
weird	0.5
wind	0.5
thing	0.5
that	0.5
happened	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
we	0.5
reach	0.5
this	0.5
cruising	0.5
altitude	0.5
er	0.5
everything	0.5
seemed	0.5
to	0.5
be	0.5
fine	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
you	0.5
know	0.5
as	0.5
soon	0.5
as	0.5
it	0.5
reaches	0.5
cruising	0.5
you	0.5
remove	0.5
your	0.5
seat	0.5
belt	0.5
S	0.5
Or	0.5
loosen	0.5
it	0.5
and	0.5
you	0.5
wanna	0.5
use	0.5
the	0.5
restroom	0.5
or	0.5
something	0.5
L	0.5
Yeah	0.5
S	0.5
But	0.5
they	0.5
said	0.5
we	0.5
couldnt	0.5
because	0.5
there	0.5
was	0.5
a	0.5
lot	0.5
of	0.5
turbulence	0.5
S	0.5
We	0.5
couldnt	0.5
take	0.5
off	0.5
our	0.5
seat	0.5
belts	0.5
the	0.5
lavatories	0.5
were	0.5
not	0.5
allowed	0.5
to	0.5
be	0.5
used	0.5
we	0.5
couldnt	0.5
go	0.5
there	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
the	0.5
plane	0.5
was	0.5
literally	0.5
shaking	0.5
left	0.5
to	0.5
right	0.5
uh	0.5
because	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
turbulence	0.5
L	0.5
Oh	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
in	0.5
my	0.5
head	0.5
all	0.5
my	0.5
worst	0.5
dreams	0.5
about	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
propeller	0.5
planes	0.5
laughs	0.5
that	0.5
come	0.5
into	0.5
mind	0.5
is	0.5
not	0.5
going	0.5
go	0.5
go	0.5
well	0.5
L	0.5
Oh	0.5
no	0.5
laughs	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
then	0.5
all	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
sudden	0.5
the	0.5
lights	0.5
go	0.5
off	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
we	0.5
see	0.5
the	0.5
lights	0.5
flashing	0.5
the	0.5
lightning	0.5
outside	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
we	0.5
see	0.5
these	0.5
lights	0.5
flashing	0.5
in	0.5
the	0.5
plane	0.5
is	0.5
S	0.5
Scene	0.5
out	0.5
of	0.5
a	0.5
horror	0.5
movie	0.5
or	0.5
something	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
uh	0.5
you	0.5
we	0.5
experience	0.5
this	0.5
uh	0.5
this	0.5
sudden	0.5
fall	0.5
S	0.5
You	0.5
see	0.5
the	0.5
sometimes	0.5
when	0.5
the	0.5
air	0.5
turbulence	0.5
is	0.5
the	0.5
plane	0.5
seems	0.5
to	0.5
be	0.5
falling	0.5
a	0.5
lot	0.5
and	0.5
getting	0.5
up	0.5
and	0.5
falling	0.5
L	0.5
Yeah	0.5
S	0.5
But	0.5
this	0.5
weird	0.5
because	0.5
it	0.5
kept	0.5
on	0.5
falling	0.5
for	0.5
like	0.5
seconds	0.5
like	0.5
10	0.5
15	0.5
seconds	0.5
we	0.5
fell	0.5
this	0.5
fall	0.5
L	0.5
Oh	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
Im	0.5
pretty	0.5
claustrophobic	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
I	0.5
dont	0.5
like	0.5
that	0.5
whole	0.5
environment	0.5
anyhow	0.5
and	0.5
this	0.5
is	0.5
getting	0.5
even	0.5
worse	0.5
for	0.5
me	0.5
L	0.5
Nobody	0.5
does	0.5
laughs	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
and	0.5
then	0.5
to	0.5
make	0.5
matters	0.5
even	0.5
worse	0.5
S	0.5
The	0.5
oxygen	0.5
masks	0.5
drop	0.5
um	0.5
L	0.5
Oh	0.5
S	0.5
I	0.5
couldnt	0.5
breathe	0.5
anyway	0.5
and	0.5
this	0.5
is	0.5
the	0.5
first	0.5
time	0.5
Im	0.5
experiencing	0.5
oxygen	0.5
masks	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
I	0.5
dont	0.5
know	0.5
how	0.5
to	0.5
use	0.5
it	0.5
although	0.5
they	0.5
tell	0.5
it	0.5
every	0.5
time	0.5
but	0.5
its	0.5
very	0.5
difficult	0.5
when	0.5
it	0.5
happens	0.5
to	0.5
you	0.5
L	0.5
Uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
Somehow	0.5
the	0.5
guy	0.5
sitting	0.5
next	0.5
to	0.5
me	0.5
helped	0.5
me	0.5
put	0.5
it	0.5
on	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
could	0.5
breathe	0.5
again	0.5
S	0.5
But	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
this	0.5
harrowing	0.5
experience	0.5
we	0.5
all	0.5
were	0.5
scared	0.5
S	0.5
The	0.5
plane	0.5
was	0.5
going	0.5
up	0.5
and	0.5
down	0.5
and	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
just	0.5
the	0.5
lights	0.5
were	0.5
off	0.5
and	0.5
S	0.5
I	0.5
we	0.5
could	0.5
see	0.5
that	0.5
the	0.5
air	0.5
