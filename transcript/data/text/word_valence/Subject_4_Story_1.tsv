on	0.19999999999999998
and	0.19999999999999998
we	0.19999999999999998
had	0.19999999999999998
like	0.19999999999999998
a	0.2
S	0.2
spoils	0.2
to	0.2
make	0.2
it	0.2
go	0.2
faster	0.2
or	0.2
something	0.2
I	0.2
dont	0.2
know	0.2
what	0.2
we	0.2
were	0.2
thinking	0.2
just	0.2
looked	0.12000000000000002
cool	0.0
laughs	0.0
like	0.0
that	0.0
uh	0.0
but	0.0
we	0.0
build	0.0
like	0.0
this	0.0
go	0.0
kart	0.0
kinda	0.0
what	0.0
we	0.0
would	0.0
do	0.0
with	0.0
this	0.0
is	0.0
that	0.0
right	0.0
next	0.0
to	0.0
my	0.0
house	0.0
there	0.0
was	0.0
this	0.0
kind	0.0
of	0.0
S	0.0
sloping	0.0
asphalted	0.0
hill	0.0
kind	0.0
of	0.0

hill	0.19999999999999998
and	0.19999999999999998
then	0.2
essentially	0.19999999999999998
someone	0.19999999999999998
was	0.2
supposed	0.19999999999999998
to	0.19999999999999998
be	0.2
sitting	0.19999999999999998
and	0.19999999999999998
the	0.19999999999999998
other	0.2
would	0.19999999999999998
just	0.19999999999999998
kind	0.2
roll	0.19999999999999998
down	0.19999999999999998
the	0.2
hill	0.19999999999999998

of	0.19999999999999998
S	0.19999999999999998
uh	0.2
and	0.19999999999999998
this	0.2
was	0.2
pretty	0.19999999999999998
fun	0.2
we	0.19999999999999998
enjoyed	0.2
laughs	0.2
we	0.19999999999999998
enjoyed	0.2
a	0.2
lot	0.19999999999999998
we	0.2
spent	0.19999999999999998
a	0.2
lot	0.2
of	0.19999999999999998
time	0.2
doing	0.19999999999999998
that	0.2
actually	0.2
in	0.19999999999999998
the	0.2
beginning	0.2
uh	0.19999999999999998
as	0.2
you	0.19999999999999998
can	0.2
imagine	0.05
this	0.0
probably	0.0
wasnt	0.0
S	0.0
the	0.0
best	0.0
idea	0.0
kind	0.0
of	0.0
um	0.0
one	0.0
day	0.0
I	0.0
got	0.0
actually	0.0
pretty	0.0
hurt	0.0
so	0.0
what	0.5
happened	0.5
is	0.5
when	0.5
we	0.5
were	0.5
taking	0.5
this	0.5
thing	0.5
up	0.5
hill	0.5
right	0.5
so	0.5
we	0.5
put	0.5
all	0.5
the	0.5
stuff	0.5
on	0.5
it	0.5
and	0.5
like	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
S	0.5
pretty	0.5
fun	0.5
to	0.5
just	0.5
roll	0.5
over	0.5
down	0.5
the	0.5
hill	0.5
what	0.5
happened	0.5
was	0.5
we	0.5
took	0.5
it	0.5
to	0.5
the	0.5
top	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
hill	0.5
I	0.5
sat	0.5
in	0.5
it	0.5
and	0.5
then	0.5
instead	0.5
of	0.5
just	0.5
rolling	0.5
down	0.5
instead	0.5
she	0.5
pushed	0.5
me	0.5
down	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
S	0.5
laughs	0.5
I	0.5
started	0.5
to	0.5
like	0.5
fly	0.5
down	0.5
this	0.5
hill	0.5
at	0.5
the	0.5
speed	0.5
but	0.5
the	0.5
thing	0.5
was	0.5
bobbling	0.5
a	0.5
lot	0.5
and	0.5
so	0.5
it	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
inaudible	0.5
flipped	0.5
and	0.5
then	0.5
it	0.5
shifted	0.5
L	0.5
laughs	0.5
S	0.5
laughs	0.5
I	0.5
started	0.5
to	0.5
like	0.5
fly	0.5
down	0.5
this	0.5
hill	0.5
at	0.5
the	0.5
speed	0.5
but	0.5
the	0.5
thing	0.5
was	0.5
bobbling	0.5
a	0.5
lot	0.5
and	0.5
so	0.5
it	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5

then	0.5
it	0.5
shifted	0.5
S	0.5
and	0.5
then	0.5
it	0.5
started	0.5
to	0.5
flip	0.5
over	0.5
but	0.5
the	0.5
thing	0.5
is	0.5
I	0.5
my	0.5
legs	0.5
were	0.5
still	0.5
stuck	0.5
on	0.5
the	0.5
thing	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
couldnt	0.5
really	0.5
get	0.5
out	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
like	0.5

on	0.5
this	0.5
side	0.5
of	0.5
my	0.5
body	0.5
and	0.5
like	0.5
going	0.5

thing	0.5
was	0.5
that	0.5
after	0.5
S	0.5
after	0.5
a	0.5
while	0.5
I	0.5
got	0.5
to	0.5
know	0.5
that	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
a	0.5
shame	0.5
really	0.5
cause	0.5
she	0.5
told	0.5
me	0.5
that	0.5
her	0.5
family	0.5
was	0.5
moving	0.5
to	0.5
Asia	0.5

of	0.5
cause	0.5
her	0.5
family	0.5
had	0.5
gotten	0.5
work	0.5
a	0.5
work	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
so	0.5
her	0.5
family	0.5
had	0.5
to	0.5
move	0.5
there	0.5
L	0.5
I	0.5

was	0.5
pretty	0.5
not	0.5
great	0.5
for	0.5
me	0.5
kinda	0.5
cause	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
still	0.5
a	0.5
very	0.5
lonely	0.5
person	0.5

S	0.5
right	0.5
so	0.5
yeah	0.5
uh	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
ashamed	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
didnt	0.5
hear	0.5
from	0.5
her	0.5
for	0.5
quite	0.5
a	0.5
long	0.5
time	0.5
actually	0.5
eventually	0.5
she	0.5
did	0.5
get	0.5
in	0.5
touch	0.5
with	0.5
me	0.5
in	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
this	0.5
one	0.5
in	0.5
one	0.5
of	0.5
these	0.5
uncomfortable	0.5
like	0.5
S	0.5
Facebook	0.5
messages	0.5
you	0.5
get	0.5
five	0.5
years	0.5
later	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
five	0.5
years	0.5
inaudible	0.5
I	0.5
received	0.5
when	0.5
she	0.5
got	0.5
in	0.5
touch	0.5
with	0.5
me	0.5
again	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
was	0.5
pretty	0.5
excited	0.5
to	0.5
hear	0.5
from	0.5
her	0.5
cause	0.5
she	0.5
kind	0.5
of	0.5
disappeared	0.5
from	0.5
the	0.5
face	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
earth	0.5
and	0.5
now	0.5
S	0.5
she	0.5
was	0.5
back	0.5
uh	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
started	0.5
to	0.5
talk	0.5
with	0.5
her	0.5
about	0.5
about	0.5
the	0.5
way	0.5
she	0.5
was	0.5
kind	0.5
and	0.5
then	0.5
I	0.5
talked	0.5
to	0.5
her	0.5
about	0.5
the	0.5
past	0.5
and	0.5
we	0.5
talked	0.5
for	0.5
a	0.5
while	0.5
but	0.5
I	0.5
could	0.5
realize	0.5
that	0.5
L	0.5
inaudible	0.5
S	0.5
she	0.5
was	0.5
back	0.5
uh	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
started	0.5
to	0.5
talk	0.5
with	0.5
her	0.5
about	0.5
about	0.5
the	0.5
way	0.5
she	0.5
was	0.5
kind	0.5
and	0.5
then	0.5
I	0.5
talked	0.5
to	0.5
her	0.5
about	0.5
the	0.5
past	0.5
and	0.5
we	0.5
talked	0.5
for	0.5
a	0.5
while	0.5
but	0.5
I	0.5
could	0.5
realize	0.5
that	0.5
S	0.5
she	0.5
was	0.5
back	0.5
uh	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
started	0.5
to	0.5
talk	0.5
with	0.5
her	0.5
about	0.5
about	0.5
the	0.5
way	0.5
she	0.5
was	0.5
kind	0.5
and	0.5
then	0.5
I	0.5
talked	0.5
to	0.5
her	0.5
about	0.5
the	0.5
past	0.5
and	0.5
we	0.5
talked	0.5
for	0.5
a	0.5
while	0.5
but	0.5
I	0.5
could	0.5
realize	0.5
that	0.5
S	0.5
I	0.5
talked	0.5
quite	0.5
a	0.5
lot	0.5
but	0.5
she	0.5
wasnt	0.5
really	0.5
into	0.5
it	0.5
she	0.5
did	0.5
obviously	0.5
uh	0.5
change	0.5
quite	0.5
a	0.5
lot	0.5
from	0.5
having	0.5
moved	0.5
I	0.5
guess	0.5
thats	0.5
kinda	0.5
happens	0.5
when	0.5
youre	0.5
a	0.5
kid	0.5
and	0.5
you	0.5
move	0.5
somewhere	0.5
laughs	0.5
you	0.5
do	0.5
change	0.5
pretty	0.5
quickly	0.5
S	0.5
uh	0.5
so	0.5
unfortunately	0.5
the	0.5
our	0.5
conversations	0.5
became	0.5
just	0.5
kinda	0.5
shorter	0.5
and	0.5
shorter	0.5
and	0.5
eventually	0.5
she	0.5
just	0.5
kinda	0.5
stopped	0.5
responding	0.5
to	0.5
my	0.5
texts	0.5
switches	0.5
S	0.5
shame	0.5
you	0.5
know	0.5
but	0.5
this	0.5
like	0.5
what	0.5
you	0.5
what	0.5
you	0.5
gonna	0.5
do	0.5
about	0.5
it	0.5
so	0.5
yeah	0.5
um	0.5
so	0.5
that	0.5
was	0.5
the	0.5
story	0.5
one	0.5
of	0.5
my	0.5
first	0.5
friends	0.5
