avoid	0.5
taking	0.5
flights	0.5
if	0.5
I	0.5
can	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
but	0.5
a	0.5
couple	0.5
of	0.5
weeks	0.5
ago	0.5
we	0.5
were	0.5
traveling	0.5
to	0.5
Zurich	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
um	0.5
I	0.5
didnt	0.5
plan	0.5
it	0.5
in	0.5
advance	0.5
L	0.5
Uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
the	0.5
plane	0.5
takes	0.5
way	0.5
too	0.5
much	0.5
time	0.5
to	0.5
go	0.5
there	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
I	0.5
found	0.5
this	0.5
really	0.5
cheap	0.5
flight	0.5
on	0.5
the	0.5
Zoom	0.5
last	0.5
minute	0.5
deals	0.5
website	0.5
L	0.5
Uhhuh	0.5

S	0.5
And	0.5
took	0.5
this	0.5
flight	0.5
um	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
really	0.5
cheap	0.5
L	0.5
Uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
To	0.5
and	0.5
fro	0.5
was	0.5
really	0.5
less	0.5
than	0.5
100	0.5
euros	0.5
L	0.5
Uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
I	0.5
took	0.5
that	0.5
flight	0.5
um	0.5
S	0.5
I	0.5
didnt	0.5
realize	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
in	0.5
the	0.5
evening	0.5
so	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
fine	0.5
for	0.5
me	0.5
I	0.5
would	0.5
reach	0.5
then	0.5
and	0.5
go	0.5
in	0.5
to	0.5
the	0.5
hotel	0.5
directly	0.5
but	0.5
S	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
like	0.5
the	0.5
last	0.5
flight	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
day	0.5
from	0.5
here	0.5
right	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
930	0.5
10pm	0.5
was	0.5
the	0.5
flight	0.5
from	0.5
here	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
S	0.5
Um	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
reach	0.5
the	0.5
airport	0.5
I	0.5
reach	0.5
the	0.5
airport	0.5
a	0.5
couple	0.5
of	0.5
hours	0.5
ago	0.5
as	0.5
I	0.5
normally	0.5
do	0.5
L	0.5
Uhhuh	0.5
yeah	0.5
S	0.5
It	0.5
was	0.5
a	0.5
bit	0.5
rainy	0.5
evening	0.5
like	0.5
normally	0.5
it	0.5
is	0.5
L	0.5
Uhhuh	0.5
okay	0.5
S	0.5
But	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
really	0.5
windy	0.5
at	0.5
that	0.5
night	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
I	0.5
reach	0.5
the	0.5
airport	0.5
and	0.5
I	0.5
see	0.5
this	0.5
huge	0.5
cue	0.5
of	0.5
people	0.5
for	0.5
check	0.5
in	0.5
S	0.5
Apparently	0.5
all	0.5
the	0.5
flights	0.5
before	0.5
my	0.5
flight	0.5
were	0.5
delayed	0.5
because	0.5
of	0.5
the	0.5
weather	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
ah	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
there	0.5
was	0.5
a	0.5
huge	0.5
huge	0.5
cue	0.5
for	0.5
check	0.5
in	0.5
the	0.5
security	0.5
was	0.5
completely	0.5
packed	0.5
L	0.5
Uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
Like	0.5
the	0.5
whole	0.5
airport	0.5
was	0.5
completely	0.5
like	0.5
stuffed	0.5
with	0.5
people	0.5
at	0.5
that	0.5
point	0.5
in	0.5
time	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
S	0.5
People	0.5
with	0.5
flight	0.5
canceled	0.5
delayed	0.5
everything	0.5
happening	0.5
that	0.5
night	0.5
L	0.5
Oh	0.5
shit	0.5
okay	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
even	0.5
with	0.5
two	0.5
hours	0.5
I	0.5
just	0.5
could	0.5
barely	0.5
manage	0.5
to	0.5
reach	0.5
the	0.5
boarding	0.5
gate	0.5
in	0.5
time	0.5
S	0.5
They	0.5
were	0.5
closing	0.5
the	0.5
gate	0.5
when	0.5
I	0.5
entered	0.5
L	0.5
Hmm	0.5
okay	0.5
S	0.5
They	0.5
let	0.5
me	0.5
in	0.5
but	0.5
they	0.5
were	0.5
not	0.5
very	0.5
happy	0.5
about	0.5
it	0.5
L	0.5
Yeah	0.5
S	0.5
I	0.5
told	0.5
them	0.5
how	0.5
the	0.5
check	0.5
in	0.5
was	0.5
really	0.5
long	0.5
and	0.5
the	0.5
security	0.5
was	0.5
just	0.5
taking	0.5
too	0.5
much	0.5
time	0.5
L	0.5
Uhhuh	0.5
uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
And	0.5
I	0.5
could	0.5
just	0.5
barely	0.5
manage	0.5
to	0.5
get	0.5
in	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5
uhhuh	0.5
S	0.5
But	0.5
they	0.5
allowed	0.5
me	0.5
to	0.5
board	0.5
the	0.5
flight	0.5
um	0.5
L	0.5
Okay	0.5

of	0.5
the	0.5
flights	0.5
they	0.5
dont	0.5
have	0.5
the	0.5
bridge	0.5
to	0.5
the	0.5
flight	0.5
S	0.5
So	0.5
you	0.5

to	0.5
go	0.5
down	0.5
and	0.5
take	0.5
the	0.5
bus	0.5
and	0.5
the	0.5
bus	0.5
goes	0.5
to	0.5
the	0.5
flight	0.5
L	0.5
Yeah	0.5
yeah	0.5
yeah	0.5
then	0.5
take	0.5
the	0.5
stairs	0.5
S	0.5
I	0.5
hate	0.5
taking	0.5

exactly	0.5
and	0.5
the	0.5
sound	0.5
of	0.5
those	0.5

are	0.5
basically	0.5
L	0.5
Yeah	0.5

it	0.5
was	0.5
too	0.5
late	0.5
for	0.5
me	0.5
to	0.5
go	0.5
anywhere	0.5
so	0.5
I	0.5
had	0.5
to	0.5
take	0.5
the	0.5
flight	0.5
I	0.5
said	0.5
okay	0.5

they	0.5
were	0.5
rushing	0.5
us	0.5
in	0.5
to	0.5
board	0.5
because	0.5
I	0.5
think	0.5
they	0.5
were	0.5
getting	0.5
late	0.5
or	0.5
something	0.5
L	0.5
Yeah	0.5
S	0.5

not	0.5
very	0.5
politely	0.5
a	0.5
bit	0.5
rude	0.5

followed	0.5
us	0.5
in	0.5
to	0.5
go	0.5
and	0.5
sit	0.5
down	0.5
like	0.5
L	0.5
Thats	0.5
weird	0.5
S	0.5
Because	0.5
we	0.5
wanna	0.5
fly	0.5
just	0.5
go	0.5
quickly	0.5
and	0.5
sit	0.5
down	0.5

told	0.5
us	0.5
that	0.5
we	0.5
cant	0.5
fly	0.5
L	0.5
What	0.5
S	0.5
Because	0.5
the	0.5
weather	0.5
is	0.5
too	0.5
bad	0.5
so	0.5
we	0.5
have	0.5
to	0.5
wait	0.5
S	0.5
They	0.5
dont	0.5
know	0.5
how	0.5
long	0.5

there	0.5
I	0.5
mean	0.5
they	0.5
had	0.5
very	0.5
minimal	0.5
so	0.5
it	0.5
was	0.5
not	0.5
much	0.5

And	0.5
the	0.5
boarding	0.5
